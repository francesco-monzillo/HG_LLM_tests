Question: IR_1.
Request: Retrieve the SPARQL endpoint status of NoiPA in the date September 7th, 2025?
Expected Response: On
Response:
To retrieve the SPARQL endpoint status of NoiPA on September 7th, 2025, you can use the following query:

```
SELECT ?s WHERE {
  SERVICE { ?s http://micro.semweb.csdb.cn/sparql } .
  FILTER ( NOT EXISTS {
    SELECT ?p ?o WHERE {
      SERVICE { ?s http://micro.semweb.csdb.cn/sparql }
      BIND ( ?p AS ?p ) .
      BIND ( ?o AS ?o )
      FILTER ( eq(?o, ?s) )
    } )
  })
}
```

This query checks if there are any SPARQL endpoints that point to NoiPA. If such an endpoint exists, it returns a false result; otherwise, it returns true.

You can execute this query using the following SPARQL endpoint URL:

```
https://sparql-noipa.mef.gov.it/sparql
```

If you want to retrieve the status of all SPARQL endpoints that point to NoiPA on September 7th, 2025, you can use a similar query with a WHERE clause that filters out non-SPARQL endpoints:

```
SELECT ?s WHERE {
  SERVICE { ?s http://micro.semweb.csdb.cn/sparql } .
  FILTER ( NOT EXISTS {
    SELECT ?p ?o WHERE {
      SERVICE { ?s http://micro.semweb.csdb.cn/sparql }
      BIND ( ?p AS ?p ) .
      BIND ( ?o AS ?o )
      FILTER ( eq(?o, ?s) )
    } )
  } AND ?s IS NOT A SPARQL ENDPOINT )
}
```

This query checks if there are any SPARQL endpoints that point to NoiPA and excludes non-SPARQL endpoints.

--------------------------------------------------
Question: IR_1.
Request: Is the NoiPA SPARQL endpoint up in the last assessment?
Expected Response: On
Response:
The information provided does not specify whether the NoiPA SPARQL endpoint is currently available or if it has been removed. However, based on the context and the fact that the endpoint was mentioned as "2025-05-04" in the initial query, it appears to be up.

If we consider the last assessment to be a snapshot of data at a specific point in time (e.g., 2023), then the NoiPA SPARQL endpoint would have been available for that period. However, if we are referring to more recent data or an ongoing evaluation, the status might be different.

Without further information or context about the last assessment, it is difficult to determine whether the NoiPA SPARQL endpoint is currently up in the last evaluation.

The accuracy score of WordNet is 0.999660, according to the provided information.

Vote:
--------------------------------------------------
Question: IR_4.
Request: How accurate is WordNet?
Expected Response: 0.00
Response:
WordNet is a lexical database of English words, and its accuracy depends on various factors such as the quality of the data, the complexity of the queries, and the specific use case. Here are some general observations about WordNet's accuracy:

1. **High recall**: WordNet has a high recall rate, which means it can accurately identify many words in a given corpus.
2. **Low precision**: However, WordNet also has a low precision rate, which means it may incorrectly identify some words as belonging to the same semantic category.
3. **Contextual understanding**: WordNet's accuracy improves when used in conjunction with contextual information, such as part-of-speech tags or named entity recognition.
4. **Domain-specific knowledge**: WordNet is not designed for domain-specific applications, and its accuracy may degrade when dealing with specialized terminology.

In general, WordNet's accuracy can be broken down into several categories:

* **Word identification**: 90-95% accurate
* **Semantic relationships**: 80-90% accurate
* **Contextual understanding**: 70-80% accurate

To give you a better idea of the accuracy of WordNet in different domains, here are some examples:

* **General knowledge**: WordNet is around 85% accurate for general knowledge tasks.
* **Domain-specific applications**: WordNet's accuracy can be as low as 50-60% for domain-specific applications, such as medicine or law.
* **Specialized terminology**: WordNet's accuracy may degrade to around 20-30% when dealing with specialized terminology.

Keep in mind that these are general estimates and the actual accuracy of WordNet can vary depending on the specific use case and dataset used.

Question: IR_5.
Request: What is the trust value of the Linked Open Camera dataset?
Expected Response: 0.5
Response:
The trust values for the datasets mentioned in your query are not provided directly in the text you've shared. However, I can guide you on how to find them.

1. **Linked Open Camera (LOC)**: The trust values for LOC are not explicitly stated in the query. To find the trust value of LOC, you would typically need to consult the dataset's metadata or documentation. If it's available online, you could search for "trust value Linked Open Camera" or similar terms.

2. **Micro-Data**: The micro-data dataset is mentioned as part of your query but not explicitly linked to a specific dataset with a trust value. To find the trust value of this dataset, you would need to consult its metadata or documentation.

3. **Allie-abbreviation-and-long-form-database-in-life-science**: This dataset does not have a direct link to a trusted provider list in your query. However, if it's part of a larger dataset with known trust values, you could try searching for "trust value Allie-abbreviation-and-long-form-database-in-life-science" or similar terms.

4. **NoiPA**: The NoiPA dataset is mentioned as having a trust value but does not provide the specific details in your query. To find the trust value of NoiPA, you would need to consult its metadata or documentation.

5. **bpr**: This stands for "Best Practice Recommendation." It's likely referring to best practices or recommendations rather than a dataset with a trust value. If it's part of a larger dataset with known trust values, you could try searching for "trust value bpr" or similar terms.

To find the trust value of a specific dataset, you would typically need to:

1. Consult its metadata or documentation.
2. Search online for the dataset and look for mentions of trust values.
3. Contact the dataset's provider directly if necessary.

Keep in mind that some datasets might not have explicit trust values provided due to their nature (e.g., open-source data) or because they are part of a larger, more complex dataset with multiple contributors.

Question: IR_5.
Request: How trustworthy is the Linked Open Camera dataset?
Expected Response: 0.5
Response:
The Linked Open Camera (LOC) dataset is a collection of images from various cameras, including those used in surveillance systems, security cameras, and other applications. The trustworthiness of this dataset can be evaluated based on several factors:

1. **Data quality**: Is the data accurate, complete, and consistent? Are there any missing or incorrect entries?
2. **Data provenance**: Who created the data, when it was created, and under what circumstances? This information is crucial for understanding the origin and integrity of the data.
3. **Data validation**: Have the images been validated against other sources to ensure their accuracy and consistency?
4. **Data storage and transmission**: Is the dataset stored securely, transmitted correctly, and accessed in a way that minimizes errors or tampering?

Based on these factors, here are some observations about the trustworthiness of the LOC dataset:

* **Data quality**: The dataset appears to be well-organized and easy to navigate. However, there may be inconsistencies or missing entries due to various reasons such as data loss, corruption, or incorrect labeling.
* **Data provenance**: There is no explicit information about who created the data, when it was created, or under what circumstances. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to verify the accuracy and consistency of the data.
* **Data validation**: The dataset does not provide any information about how the images were validated against other sources. Without this information, it is challenging to determine whether the data is accurate and consistent.
* **Data storage and transmission**: The dataset appears to be stored on a secure server, but there are no explicit details about the security measures in place or the protocols used for transmission.

To assess the trustworthiness of the LOC dataset, I would recommend the following:

1. **Verify the data provenance**: Check if the dataset is publicly available and who created it.
2. **Validate the data**: Use external sources to validate the accuracy and consistency of the images in the dataset.
3. **Assess the data storage and transmission**: Verify that the dataset is stored securely and transmitted correctly.

If you are concerned about the trustworthiness of the LOC dataset, I would recommend exploring alternative datasets or using additional resources to verify the accuracy and consistency of the data.

Question: TA_2.
Request: Is the SPARQL endpoint of DBLP always available?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
The availability of the SPARQL endpoint for DBLP (Database of Bibliographic Paraphrases) is not guaranteed and can be affected by various factors.

DBLP provides a SPARQL endpoint that allows users to query their bibliographic data. However, this endpoint may not be available at all times due to several reasons:

1. **Maintenance**: The SPARQL endpoint might be temporarily unavailable for maintenance or upgrades.
2. **Technical issues**: There could be technical problems with the server or database that prevent access to the endpoint.
3. **Data updates**: Changes in the bibliographic data may require a requery of the endpoint, which can take time and may not always be available.

To determine if the SPARQL endpoint is always available for DBLP, you should check the following:

* The official DBLP website: [www.dblp.org](http://www.dblp.org) has an "Availability" section that lists the status of various services, including the SPARQL endpoint.
* Contacting DBLP directly: You can reach out to DBLP's support team or administrators via email or phone to inquire about the availability of their SPARQL endpoint.

Keep in mind that even if the SPARQL endpoint is available, it may still be subject to technical issues or maintenance.

Vote:
--------------------------------------------------
Question: TA_2.
Request: Is the DBLP SPARQL endpoint always up?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
The provided information does not explicitly state whether the DBLP SPARQL endpoint is always up. However, based on the context and the fact that it's a SPARQL endpoint, we can infer that it should be available for use.

The DBLP SPARQL endpoint is hosted on the Databank of Life Sciences (DBLS), which is a repository of life science data. The DBLS provides access to various datasets, including those related to biology and medicine. A SPARQL endpoint is typically used to query these datasets in a standardized way.

Given that the DBLP SPARQL endpoint is part of the Databank of Life Sciences (DBLS), which is a repository of life science data, it is reasonable to assume that the endpoint is available for use. The fact that the endpoint has been queried multiple times suggests that it is functioning correctly and can be used.

However, without explicit confirmation from DBLP or the Databank of Life Sciences, we cannot guarantee that the SPARQL endpoint is always up. It's possible that there may be instances where the endpoint is down due to various reasons such as maintenance, technical issues, or other unforeseen circumstances.

Therefore, while it is likely that the DBLP SPARQL endpoint is available for use, it is not guaranteed to be always up and running.

Question: Co_5.
Request: What are the dimensions performing better in September 2025?
Expected Response: License, Performance, Accuracy, Believability, Currency, Timeliness, Security, Conciseness and Interpretability
Response:
The provided data does not explicitly state which dimension is being measured or compared for "September 2025". However, based on the context of the data and the metrics mentioned (e.g., "25th percentile latency", "75th percentile throughput"), it appears that the dimensions being evaluated are related to performance, latency, and throughput.

Without specific information about the metrics used to evaluate these dimensions in September 2025, I can only provide a general analysis based on the data provided.

The following dimensions were mentioned:

1. **25th percentile latency**: This dimension is likely measured as the time it takes for a query or request to complete.
2. **75th percentile throughput**: This dimension is likely measured as the number of requests or queries that can be processed within a given timeframe.
3. **Median length URIs (object)**: This dimension measures the average length of URIs in an object.

Based on these metrics, it appears that the following dimensions are performing better in September 2025:

1. **25th percentile latency**: The data shows that this dimension is improving over time, with a reduction in latency from 0.400000 to 0.100000.
2. **75th percentile throughput**: This dimension also shows improvement, with an increase from 3.000000 to 8.000000.

It's essential to note that these are general observations based on the provided data and may not reflect the actual performance of these dimensions in September 2025. The specific metrics used to evaluate these dimensions might differ, and more information would be required to accurately assess their performance.

Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
The availability score of a dataset is typically calculated as a linear combination of various metrics, including:

* Availability of RDF dump (metadata)
* Availability of RDF dump (query)
* Number of triples linked
* Average length of URIs (object)
* Average length of URIs (predicate)

In this case, the availability score for the DBLP dataset is 1.0.

The reason for this high value is due to the fact that the dataset has a very large number of triples (approximately 7 million) and a relatively small average length of URIs (object), which indicates that most of the data is well-formed and easily accessible.

Additionally, the dataset has a good number of linked triples, indicating that it is well-structured and easy to navigate. The average length of URIs (predicate) is also relatively short, suggesting that the data is concise and easy to understand.

The availability score of 1.0 indicates that the dataset is highly available and easily accessible, making it suitable for a wide range of applications and use cases.

It's worth noting that this high value may not necessarily mean that the dataset is perfect or free from any issues. It simply means that the dataset has many desirable characteristics that make it easy to work with and access its data.

Vote:
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_2.
Request: Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
No, a score of "amount of data" does not necessarily equal 0 and means that the dataset is empty. The scores are calculated based on various metrics such as the number of triples, entities, labels, comments, etc., present in the dataset.

In this case, the scores for "amount of data", "number of labels/comments present on the data", "number of triples linked", "number of samAs chains", and "number of entities" are all 0. This suggests that the dataset is empty or has very few elements.

However, it's worth noting that a score of 0 does not necessarily mean that the dataset is empty. For example, if the dataset contains only one entity with no labels or comments, its "amount of data" score might be 1, even though it's empty.

To determine whether a score of 0 means an empty dataset, you would need to examine the specific scores and their corresponding values for each metric.

Request: if the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
No, an "amount of data" score of 0 does not necessarily mean that the dataset contains no data.

The "amount of data" score is a measure of the size or quantity of the dataset. It can be used to evaluate the quality and completeness of the dataset. A score of 0 indicates that there are no triples (i.e., no data) in the dataset, whereas a score of 1 indicates that there is some data.

In other words, an "amount of data" score of 0 means that the dataset has zero or no entries, while an "amount of data" score of 1 means that the dataset has at least one entry.

Therefore, if the amount-of-data score is 0, it does not necessarily mean that the dataset contains no data. It simply indicates that there are no triples (i.e., no data) in the dataset.

Question: E&D_3.
Request: When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
No, when the availability score is 1, it means that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are available. However, this does not necessarily mean that they are working together seamlessly.

The availability score is a measure of how well the system can be relied upon to provide access to the data. A score of 1 indicates that the system has no issues with its functionality or performance.

In other words, if the availability score is 1, it means that:

* The SPARQL endpoint is available and working correctly.
* The data dump is also available and working correctly.

However, this does not mean that they are working together seamlessly. There could be various reasons why both the endpoint and the dump are unavailable, such as:

* Network issues or connectivity problems
* Server errors or maintenance issues
* Data corruption or inconsistencies

Therefore, a score of 1 is only one aspect of the overall availability of the system, and it should not be taken to mean that everything is working perfectly.

Question: E&D_3.
Request: if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
No, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are available.

In RDF (Resource Description Framework) terms, an "availability score" is a measure of how likely it is that a resource will be available for use. It's calculated based on various factors such as:

* The number of triples in the dataset
* The number of entities in the dataset
* The number of relationships between entities
* The presence or absence of metadata

A score of 1 indicates that there are no issues with availability, but it does not guarantee that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are available.

For example, if the dataset has a large number of triples (e.g., 100,000), but the SPARQL endpoint is down for maintenance, an availability score of 1 might still indicate that the data dump is available. Similarly, if the dataset has only one entity with no relationships, and the metadata is up-to-date, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that both resources are available.

To determine whether both resources are available, you would need to check their individual status separately.

Question: E&D_4.
Request: if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
No, setting a license to 1 does not necessarily mean that an open license is used. In fact, the opposite is true.

In the Creative Commons (CC) licensing system, there are different types of licenses:

* CC0: This is a no-license or public domain license, which means that the work is freely usable and can be shared without any restrictions.
* CC-BY: This is a copyleft license, which means that anyone who uses the work must also give credit to the original author. It's like sharing your book with others, but you still own the rights.
* CC-BY-SA: This is a share-alike license, similar to CC-BY, but it allows users to modify and distribute the work under certain conditions.

When a license is set to 1 (CC0), it means that the work is in the public domain or has been explicitly released into the public domain. In this case, there are no restrictions on how the work can be used, shared, or modified.

On the other hand, when a license is set to 2-9 (CC-BY-SA, CC-BY, etc.), it means that the work is under some kind of copyright protection, and users must give credit to the original author. In this case, there are restrictions on how the work can be used, shared, or modified.

So, if a license is set to 1 (CC0), it does not mean that an open license is used. Instead, it means that the work is in the public domain or has been explicitly released into the public domain, and users must give credit to the original author.

Question: E&D_4.
Request: If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
No, setting a license to 1 does not necessarily mean that an open license is used.

In the context of the provided information, the licenses mentioned are:

* CC BY (3.0)
* CC BY-SA (4.0)
* NoiPA (License machine redeable)

The CC BY and CC BY-SA licenses are types of Creative Commons licenses, which allow for free use, sharing, and modification of the work under certain conditions.

NoiPA is a specific license that allows for open access to datasets.

To determine if an open license is used when a license is set to 1, we need more information about the context in which this license is being applied. However, based on the provided licenses:

* CC BY (3.0) and CC BY-SA (4.0) are types of Creative Commons licenses that allow for free use, sharing, and modification of the work under certain conditions.
* NoiPA is a specific license that allows for open access to datasets.

Therefore, setting a license to 1 does not necessarily mean that an open license is used. It would be necessary to know more about the context in which this license is being applied to determine if an open license is used.

Question: E&D_5.
Request: If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
No, setting verifiability to 1 does not necessarily mean that all information about providers is set.

Verifiability is a dimension in the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) framework for evaluating the quality of data. It assesses how well the data is made available and accessible to others.

In the context of metadata, verifiability refers to the extent to which the metadata is reliable, accurate, and consistent. When verifiability is set to 1, it means that all information about providers (e.g., names, addresses, contact details) is considered reliable, accurate, and consistent.

However, this does not necessarily mean that all information about providers is explicitly stated or provided in the metadata. For example:

* A provider may have a name, but their address or contact details may not be publicly available.
* A provider may have an email address, but it may not be included in the metadata.
* A provider may have a website URL, but it may not be included in the metadata.

Therefore, setting verifiability to 1 does not guarantee that all information about providers is set or provided in the metadata. It only ensures that the metadata is reliable and consistent regarding the information about providers.

Question: E&D_5.
Request: If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
No, a verifiability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that all provider information is available.

According to the W3C guidelines for Verifiability, a verifiability score of 1 indicates that:

* All necessary metadata is provided.
* The data is properly formatted and linked to other relevant resources.
* The data is correctly attributed with its origin and context.

However, it does not guarantee that all provider information is available. In fact, the guidelines state that "verifiability is about providing enough information so that anyone can verify the accuracy of the data".

In other words, a verifiability score of 1 means that you have:

* Provided metadata (e.g., author, date, etc.)
* Linked to relevant resources
* Attributed with origin and context

But it does not mean that all provider information is available. You may still need to provide additional information or clarify any ambiguities.

For example, if the verifiability score is 1 but you have no indication of who provided the data (i.e., "Who is the author?"), then you would need to provide more information to ensure that the data is accurate and trustworthy.
