--------------------------------------------------

Question: TA_2.
Request: Is the SPARQL endpoint of DBLP always available?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, the SPARQL endpoint for the DBLP Knowledge Graph is highly available.
The raw availability score for the SPARQL endpoint was consistently recorded as 1.00 on multiple dates, including May 4, 2025, and September 7, 2025.
A score of 1.00 indicates that the endpoint was operational and available during those specific checks.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: TA_2.
Request: Is the DBLP SPARQL endpoint always up?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
While the dblp SPARQL endpoint strives for high availability, it is not guaranteed to be "always up."
As of a September 2024 announcement, the service was in a public beta phase, with a disclaimer that users should be prepared for potential disruptions and outages.
However, monitoring data from May and September 2025 shows a SPARQL endpoint availability score of 1.00, indicating it was fully operational at the time of those measurements.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: TA_3
Request: Is the data dump of the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset always set to 1 in the observed period?
Expected Response: No, it is discontinuous
Response:
No, the raw RDF dump availability for the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset was not always set to 1 during the observed period.

On September 7, 2025, the value for RDF dump availability was 0.00. Prior to that date, it was consistently 1.00 on May 4, 2025, June 1, 2025, July 6, 2025, and August 3, 2025.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: TA_3
Request: Is the data dump of the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset always up?
Expected Response: No, it is discontinuous
Response:
Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively say whether the data dump of the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset is always up to date.

Here's what the data indicates:

Update Frequency: The dataset has a specified monthly update frequency.

No Guarantee of Real-Time Updates: While there is a monthly update schedule, this does not guarantee that the data dump is always current in real-time. There may be periods between updates where the dump does not reflect the absolute latest information.

Offline Dumps Available: The dataset is available for download via offline dumps at the following FTP locations: ftp://ftp.dbcls.jp/allie/allie_rdf/allie_rdf_nt_latest.gz and ftp://ftp.dbcls.jp/allie/allie_rdf/. The filename allie_rdf_nt_latest.gz suggests that it is intended to be the most recent version.

In conclusion, while there is a regular update schedule, the term "always up" is absolute. The data is updated monthly, so it is periodically brought up to date, but it is not continuously updated in real-time.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: TA_4.
Request: Is the accuracy of NoiPA constant over time?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Yes, based on the provided data, the accuracy of NoiPA has been constant over time.

The accuracy score for NoiPA was recorded on three different dates, and on each occasion, the score was 1.00.

Here are the specific data points:

2025-05-04: An accuracy score of 1.00.

2025-08-03: An accuracy score of 1.00.

2025-09-07: An accuracy score of 1.00.

This indicates that throughout the period covered by the data, from May to September 2025, the accuracy of NoiPA remained unchanged.
--------------------------------------------------
Question TA_4.
Request: Does the accuracy of NoiPA remain consistent over time?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Yes, based on the available data, the accuracy of NoiPA has remained consistent over time.

The accuracy score for NoiPA was 1.00 on three separate dates in 2025:

May 4th

August 3rd

--------------------------------------------------

Question: TA_5.
Request: What is the longest continuous period in which the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset data dump has been equals to 1?
Expected Response: 91 days
Response:
The longest continuous period in which the RDF data dump for the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset was available (indicated by a value of "1.00") is 91 days, from May 4, 2025, to August 3, 2025.

The availability of the RDF dump was recorded as "1.00" on the following dates:

May 4, 2025

June 1, 2025

July 6, 2025

August 3, 2025

The continuous period of availability ended on September 7, 2025, when the value changed to "0.00".
--------------------------------------------------
Question TA_5.
Request: For how long, without interruption, has the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset data dump remained up?
Expected Response: 91 days
Response:
Based on the available information, the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset data dump has not remained up without interruption.

Evidence from the provided data indicates a change in the availability of the RDF dump. On August 3, 2025, the "RDF dump availability raw" was recorded as "1.00", signifying it was available. However, on a later check, dated September 7, 2025, the same metric was "0.00", indicating it was no longer available.
This shows that there was an interruption in the availability of the data dump between these two dates.

--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the availability score for the dblp Knowledge Graph was 1.00 on the measurement date of 2025-08-03.
This perfect score is because the key metrics that contribute to the availability dimension all had a perfect score of 1.00 on that date:
SPARQL Endpoint Availability: The raw score was 1.00 (_SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw).
RDF Dump Availability: The raw score was 1.00 (_RDF_dump_availability_raw).
URI Dereferenceability: The raw score was 1.00 (_URIs_dereferenceability_raw).
Availability for Download: The metadata value for download availability was 1.00 (_availability_for_download_metadata_value_).
Since the dataset is fully accessible via its SPARQL endpoint, provides a downloadable RDF dump, and its URIs are dereferenceable, it achieved the maximum possible score for the availability dimension.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data from August 3, 2025, the dblp Knowledge Graph has an availability score of 1.00 because it is highly accessible through multiple methods.
Specifically, the high score is due to these factors:
SPARQL Endpoint: The dataset has a fully available SPARQL endpoint, as indicated by the score of 1.00 for _SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw.
RDF Dump: It also provides a downloadable RDF dump, shown by the score of 1.00 for _RDF_dump_availability_raw.
Download URLs: The specific URLs for downloading the dataset are provided: ['https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples', 'https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz'].
The combination of a queryable endpoint and available data dumps for offline use results in a perfect availability score.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_2.
Request: Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided data, a score of 0 for the amount of data dimension does not necessarily mean the dataset is empty.
For the dataset CIDOC-CRM, the _number_of_triples_in_dataset is "0.00", indicating it is empty. However, its _amount_of_data_dimension_score is consistently "0.33" across multiple dates (e.g., 2025-05-04, 2025-08-03, 2025-09-07).
This suggests that the _amount_of_data_dimension_score is calculated based on multiple factors, and a dataset with zero triples can still have a score greater than zero.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_2.
Request: If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided data, an amount-of-data score of 0 would not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data.
In fact, the opposite appears to be true in one case: the CIDOC-CRM dataset has a _number_of_triples_in_dataset of 0.00, but its _amount_of_data_dimension_score is 0.33.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_3.
Request: When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the data provided, a high availability score (close to or at 1.00) indicates that both the SPARQL endpoint and the RDF data dump are available. A score significantly lower than 1.00 occurs when one of them is unavailable.
Here are some examples from the file that support this conclusion:
dblp Knowledge Graph:
_SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw: 1.00 (available)
_RDF_dump_availability_raw: 1.00 (available)
_availability_dimension_score: 0.97 (a very high score)
Coronavirus dataset:
_SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw: 1.00 (available)
_RDF_dump_availability_raw: -1.00 (unavailable)
_availability_dimension_score: 0.74 (a lower score because the dump is unavailable)
BBC Programmes:
_SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw: -1.00 (unavailable)
_RDF_dump_availability_raw: 1.00 (available)
_availability_dimension_score: 0.25 (a very low score because the endpoint is unavailable)
Therefore, while no dataset has a score of exactly 1.00 in this file, the pattern shows that to achieve a score near 1, both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump must be working.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_3.
Request: if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the data provided, an availability score of 1.00 is a very strong indicator that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are available, but it's not the only factor.
Here is a breakdown of the evidence:
Case 1: Score is 1.00
For the dblp Knowledge Graph on 2025-08-03, we see:
_availability_dimension_score: 1.00 (record 20136)
_SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw: 1.00 (record 19993)
_RDF_dump_availability_raw: 1.00 (record 19994)
In this instance, a score of 1.00 does correspond to both being available.
Case 2: Score is less than 1.00, but both are available
For the dblp Knowledge Graph on 2025-05-04, we see:
_availability_dimension_score: 0.97 (record 3476)
_SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw: 1.00 (record 3333)
_RDF_dump_availability_raw: 1.00 (record 3334)
This shows that even when both the endpoint and dump are available, the score can be less than 1.00. This implies the _availability_dimension_score is a composite metric that includes other factors beyond just the raw up/down status of the main access points.
Case 3: One is unavailable
For the NoiPA dataset on 2025-05-04, we see:
_availability_dimension_score: 0.50 (record 8376)
_SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw: 1.00 (record 8233)
_RDF_dump_availability_raw: -1.00 (record 8234)
Here, with only one of the two being available, the score drops significantly to 0.50.
Conclusion:
An availability score of 1.00 means that both the SPARQL endpoint and the RDF dump are available, and other availability-related metrics are also optimal. If either the endpoint or the dump were unavailable, the score would be substantially lower than 1.00.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_4.
Request: if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, yes, a value of 1.00 for a license-related metric indicates that a machine-readable or human-readable license was successfully found, and in these cases, it is an open license.
Here's a breakdown using examples from your file:
For "Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science":
The metric _human_readable_license has a value of 1.00.
The corresponding raw data for this metric, _human_readable_license_raw, shows the URL: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.1/jp/. This is a Creative Commons Attribution license, which is an open license.
For "dblp Knowledge Graph":
The metric _machine_readable_license_metadata has a value of 1.00.
The corresponding raw data, _machine_readable_license_metadata_raw, shows the URL: http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-zero. This is the Creative Commons Zero (Public Domain) license, which is also an open license.
In summary, a value of 1.00 in fields like _human_readable_license or _machine_readable_license_metadata signifies that the system successfully identified a license, and the associated raw data confirms that the identified license is an open one.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_4.
Request: If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, the answer is nuanced. Here's a breakdown:
Generally, yes, a score of 1.00 for a license-related metric indicates that an open and retrievable license was found. However, which specific metric is "set to 1" matters.
Strong Indicator: When the overall _licensing_dimension_score is 1.00, it signifies that an open license is clearly specified and accessible in both human and machine-readable formats.
Example: "Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science" has a _licensing_dimension_score of 1.00 and uses an open CC-BY license.
Partial Indicator: A dataset can have a score of 1.00 for one specific metric, like _machine_readable_license_metadata, but 0.00 for another, like _human_readable_license. This still points to an open license being used, but indicates it was only found in one format.
Example: "dblp Knowledge Graph" has a 1.00 for _machine_readable_license_metadata (corresponding to a CC-Zero license) but a 0.00 for _human_readable_license. Its overall _licensing_dimension_score is 0.50.
Contradictory Cases: There are instances where the data is contradictory.
Example: For "CIDOC-CRM", the _machine_readable_license_metadata score is 1.00, but the raw data for that metric is "False", and its overall _licensing_dimension_score is 0.00, indicating no license was actually found.
In conclusion: While a license metric being set to 1.00 is a strong sign that an open license is used, it's more reliable to look at the overall _licensing_dimension_score for a complete picture.
A score of 1.00 on a specific sub-metric (e.g., _machine_readable_license_metadata) indicates success in finding a license in that particular format, but doesn't guarantee it was found in all formats.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_5.
Request: If believability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the data provided, the answer is no. A _believability_dimension_score of 1.00 does not necessarily mean that all information about providers (authors, contributors, publishers, sources) is set.
The _believability_dimension_score is a composite metric. We can see from the "dblp Knowledge Graph" data on 2025-05-04 that even with some provider information missing, the dataset can still have a high score in related metrics.
For example, for the dblp Knowledge Graph:
_authors_specified is 1.00 (3383)
_sources_specified is 1.00 (3389)
However, _contributors_specified is 0.00 (3385)
And _publishers_specified is 0.00 (3387)
This shows that a dataset can have some, but not all, provider information specified.
While this information contributes to the overall believability, a perfect score in the believability dimension is not solely dependent on every single provider field being filled.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_5.
Request: If the believability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
No, based on the data provided, a believability score of 1.00 does not mean that all provider information is available.
For example, the "Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality" dataset has a _believability_dimension_score of 1.00, but the value for its _authors is "False", indicating that this information is not available.
--------------------------------------------------
