Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the "Availability score" is a composite measure calculated from several individual availability metrics. For the DBLP dataset (dblp-kg), the score is 1.00 on dates like July 13, 2025, and August 3, 2025, because it performs perfectly on the key metrics that contribute to this score.
Here are the specific reasons drawn from the data:
SPARQL Endpoint: The dataset's SPARQL endpoint is listed as "Available".
{"14272":["Available","Sparql endpoint","dblp-kg",{"label":"2025-07-13"}]}
RDF Dump Availability: The metadata RDF dump is fully available and downloadable, scoring a perfect 1.00.
{"14273":["1.000000","Availability of RDF dump (metadata)","dblp-kg",{"label":"2025-07-13"}]}
{"14378":["1.000000","Availability for download (metadata)","dblp-kg",{"label":"2025-07-13"}]}
No Inactive Links: The check for inactive links returned "False", meaning no broken links were found, which is a positive indicator for availability.
{"14375":["False","Inactive links","dblp-kg",{"label":"2025-07-13"}]}
High FAIR Availability Scores: The dataset also achieves a perfect score of 1.00 on several FAIR-related availability metrics.
{"14457":["1.000000","A1-D Working access point(s)","dblp-kg",{"label":"2025-07-13"}]}
{"14458":["1.000000","A1-M Metadata availability via working primary sources","dblp-kg",{"label":"2025-07-13"}]}
In summary, the DBLP dataset has a perfect availability score of 1.00 because its access points (SPARQL endpoint and metadata RDF dump) are online and working correctly, and it meets all the criteria for the individual metrics that constitute the overall score.

Vote: 1
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the DBLP dataset (dblp-kg) has an availability score of 1.0 (as seen on dates like 2025-07-13 and 2025-08-03) because it is highly accessible through multiple methods:
Available RDF Dump: The dataset is available for download as an RDF dump, which is confirmed by a score of 1.0 for the "Availability of RDF dump (metadata)" metric. The specific download URLs are provided: https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples and https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz.
Available SPARQL Endpoint: The dataset is also accessible via a SPARQL endpoint. The data indicates that a "Sparql endpoint" is "Available" and provides the URL: https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql.
The combination of having both a downloadable data dump and a queryable SPARQL endpoint results in a perfect score for metrics like "A1-D Working access point(s)" and contributes to the overall availability score of 1.

Vote: 1
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_2.
Request: Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided data, a score of 0 for "Amount of data score" does not necessarily mean the dataset is empty, but it indicates that the metrics used to calculate the score were either zero or could not be retrieved.
Here's the breakdown from the file:
Definition of the Score: The "Amount of data score" is defined as an "Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores".
Contributing Metrics: The individual metrics that belong to the "Amount of data" dimension include:
Number of triples (query)
Number of entities
Number of property
A score of 0 for the combined "Amount of data score" implies that the values for these underlying metrics were likely zero or that the information could not be retrieved (e.g., the SPARQL endpoint was missing or a VoID file was absent). Therefore, it strongly suggests the dataset is either empty or its size could not be measured.

Vote: 1
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_2.
Request: If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided information, a score of 0 for "Amount of data score" does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data.
Here's why:
The "Amount of data score" is defined as a "linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores."
These individual metrics include things like "Number of triples (query)," "Number of entities," and "Number of triples (metadata)."
Many of these metrics rely on specific inputs, such as a "(working) SPARQL endpoint" or a "VoID file."
If these inputs are missing or inaccessible, the metric's output is often recorded as - or None. For example, the "Number of triples (query)" metric returns - if "The SPARQL endpoint is missing."
Therefore, an "Amount of data score" of 0 likely means that the system was unable to retrieve any of the individual metrics needed to calculate a score. The dataset might still exist in a data dump, but if the SPARQL endpoint is down or missing, the metrics that depend on it will fail, resulting in a score of 0.

Vote: 1
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_3.
Request: When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, an availability score of 1.0 does not necessarily mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working.
Here is a specific example from the file:
For the dataset dblp-kg on the date 2025-08-03:
The "Availability score" is 1.000000.
{"24470":["1.000000","Availability score","dblp-kg",{"label":"2025-08-03"}]}
The "Sparql endpoint" is "Available".
{"24322":["Available","Sparql endpoint","dblp-kg",{"label":"2025-08-03"}]}
However, the "Availability of RDF dump (query)" is "False", which according to its definition means "The RDF dump is offline".
{"24423":["Availability of RDF dump (query)","False","dblp-kg",{"label":"2025-08-03"}]}
This example shows that a dataset can have a perfect availability score of 1.0 with a working SPARQL endpoint, even if its RDF dump is offline.

Vote: 0
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_3.
Request: if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, no, an availability score of 1 does not guarantee that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up.
For example, for the dblp-kg dataset on 2025-08-03:
The "Availability score" is 1.000000.
{"24470":["1.000000","Availability score","dblp-kg",{"label":"2025-08-03"}]}
The "Sparql endpoint" is Available.
{"24322":["Available","Sparql endpoint","dblp-kg",{"label":"2025-08-03"}]}
However, the "Availability of RDF dump (query)" is False, meaning the dump is offline.
{"24423":["Availability of RDF dump (query)","False","dblp-kg",{"label":"2025-08-03"}]}
This shows that a dataset can have a perfect availability score of 1 even when its RDF dump is offline, as long as another primary access point like the SPARQL endpoint is working.

Question: E&D_4.
Request: if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, a value of "1" for the measure R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source does not necessarily mean that an open license is used.
According to the definition in the file:
"output":"1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise"
This means a value of "1" simply indicates that a license was found and is explicitly reported. The description for this measure is "Any license retrievable", which does not specify that the license must be open.

Vote: 1
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_4.
Request: If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, no, a value of 1 for a license does not necessarily mean that an open license is used.
The measure R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source is defined as follows:
code
JSON
"output":"1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise"
This means a value of "1" simply indicates that a license was found and is explicitly reported, not that the license itself is an open one. It only confirms the presence and retrievability of license information.

Question: E&D_5.
Request: If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, yes, a Verifiability score of 1 would mean that all the individual metrics contributing to that score are present and have received a perfect score.
Here's the breakdown from the file:
Verifiability Score Definition: The Verifiability score is defined as an "Overall score for the verifiability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores." Its best value is 1.
Provider Information Metrics: The metrics related to provider information that fall under the "Verifiability" dimension include:
Author (metadata)
Author (query)
Publisher
Contributor
Sources
Since the overall score is a combination of these individual scores, the only way to achieve a perfect score of 1 is if all the component metrics also have perfect scores.
Therefore, a Verifiability score of 1 indicates that information about the author, publisher, contributors, and sources is fully provided according to the assessment criteria.

Vote: 1
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_5.
Request: If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided information, yes.
The Verifiability score is described as an "Overall score for the verifiability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores," with 1 being the "Best value."
The individual metrics that contribute to this score (those with "dimension":"Verifiability") include:
Sources: "stating the author and his contributors, the publisher of the data and its sources"
Author (query): "stating the author and his contributors, the publisher of the data and its sources"
Publisher: "stating the author and his contributors, the publisher of the data and its sources"
Contributor: "stating the author and his contributors, the publisher of the data and its sources"
Author (metadata): "stating the author and his contributors, the publisher of the data and its sources"
Since the overall score is a combination of these individual metrics and 1 is the best possible score, it implies that the individual metrics related to provider information (author, publisher, contributors, sources) also have their best possible values, meaning that information is available.
