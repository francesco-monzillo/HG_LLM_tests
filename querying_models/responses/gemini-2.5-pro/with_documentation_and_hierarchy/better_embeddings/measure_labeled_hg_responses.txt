Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the "Availability score" is a composite measure calculated from several individual availability metrics. The DBLP dataset achieves a perfect score of 1.0 on multiple dates because it scores highly across these key metrics.
Here are the specific reasons drawn from the text:
SPARQL Endpoint: The dataset consistently has an "Available" SPARQL endpoint.
{"14473":["2025-07-13","Available","dblp-kg",{"label":"Sparql endpoint"}]}
{"24523":["2025-08-03","Available","dblp-kg",{"label":"Sparql endpoint"}]}
RDF Dump Availability: The metadata indicates that an RDF dump is available and downloadable, with a perfect score of 1.0.
{"14474":["1.000000","2025-07-13","dblp-kg",{"label":"Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"}]}
{"14579":["1.000000","2025-07-13","dblp-kg",{"label":"Availability for download (metadata)"}]}
Performance: The dataset scores perfectly on performance metrics like low latency and high throughput.
{"14500":["1.000000","2025-07-13","dblp-kg",{"label":"_low_latency"}]}
{"14508":["1.000000","2025-07-13","dblp-kg",{"label":"_high_throughput"}]}
Dereferenceable URIs: The URIs within the dataset are dereferenceable, also achieving a perfect score on the dates when the overall availability score is 1.0.
{"14475":["1.000000","2025-07-13","dblp-kg",{"label":"URIs Deferenceability"}]}
In summary, the DBLP dataset's perfect availability score is due to its excellent performance in providing access through both a SPARQL endpoint and a downloadable RDF dump, combined with high scores in performance and URI resolvability.

Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the DBLP dataset (dblp-kg) has an availability score of 1.00 on multiple dates (e.g., 2025-07-13 and 2025-08-03) because it excels in several key availability metrics:
SPARQL Endpoint: The dataset has a consistently "Available" SPARQL endpoint, which allows for live queries of the data.
{"14473":["2025-07-13","Available","dblp-kg",{"label":"Sparql endpoint"}]}
{"14573":["2025-07-13","dblp-kg","https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql",{"label":"SPARQL endpoint URL"}]}
Downloadable RDF Dumps: The dataset is available for download as an RDF dump, with clear URLs provided. This allows users to obtain the entire dataset for offline use.
{"14575":["2025-07-13","['https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples'. 'https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz']","dblp-kg",{"label":"URL for download the dataset"}]}
Perfect Sub-Scores: It scores a perfect 1.0 on multiple specific availability measures, including:
A1-D Working access point(s): {"14658":["1.000000","2025-07-13","dblp-kg",{"label":"A1-D Working access point(s)"}]}
Availability for download (metadata): {"14579":["1.000000","2025-07-13","dblp-kg",{"label":"Availability for download (metadata)"}]}
Availability of RDF dump (metadata): {"14474":["1.000000","2025-07-13","dblp-kg",{"label":"Availability of RDF dump (metadata)"}]}
No Barriers to Access: The dataset does not require authentication to access, making it freely and easily available.
{"14491":["2025-07-13","False","dblp-kg",{"label":"Requires authentication"}]}
In summary, the DBLP dataset achieves a perfect availability score because it is accessible through multiple, fully operational methods (both a live SPARQL endpoint and downloadable files) without any access restrictions.

--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_2.
Request: Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided information, a score of 0 for "Amount of data score" does not necessarily mean the dataset is completely empty, but it indicates that the amount of data is either zero or extremely low.
Here's the breakdown from the file:
Amount of data score description: "Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores".
Individual metrics: This score is calculated from other metrics in the "Amount of data" dimension, such as:
Number of triples
Number of entities
Number of properties
A score of 0 means that the combined, weighted score of these individual metrics is 0. This would happen if a dataset had 0 triples, 0 entities, and 0 properties, but it could also result from a dataset being so small that its score rounds down to 0.

Vote: 0
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_2.
Request: If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided information, no, an amount-of-data score of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data.
The "Amount of data score" is described as an "Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores". These individual metrics include things like "Number of triples", "Number of entities", and "Number of property".
Therefore, a score of 0 is the lowest possible value on a scale from [0,1], but it represents a computed score, not a direct count of the data.

Vote: 0.5
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_3.
Request: When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, no, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working.
For example, for the dblp-kg dataset on July 13, 2025:
The "Availability score" is "1.000000".
The "Sparql endpoint" is "Available".
However, the "Availability of RDF dump (query)" is "False", which means the RDF dump is offline.
This shows that a dataset can have a perfect availability score of 1 even if only the SPARQL endpoint is working and the data dump is offline.

Vote: 0
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_3.
Request: if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided text, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up.
The definition for "Availability score" states that it is an "Overall score for the availability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual availability metrics scores". This suggests it's a calculated value, not a simple check for both being online.
For example, the dataset dblp-kg has an "Availability score" of 1.0, but its RDF dump is offline:
Availability score: {"24671":["1.000000","2025-08-03","dblp-kg",{"label":"Availability score"}]}
Sparql endpoint: {"24523":["2025-08-03","Available","dblp-kg",{"label":"Sparql endpoint"}]}
Availability of RDF dump (query): {"24624":["2025-08-03","False","dblp-kg",{"label":"Availability of RDF dump (query)"}]}
This shows that a dataset can have a perfect availability score even if only the SPARQL endpoint is available and the RDF dump is offline.

Question: E&D_4.
Request: if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, no, a value of 1 for a license measure does not necessarily mean that an open license is used.
According to the definition in the file:
code
JSON
{"R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source":{"type":"measure","description":"Any license retrievable","input":"(Meta)data","output":"1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise","dimension":"FAIR"}}
A value of 1 for the measure "R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source" simply means that a license was found and is explicitly reported. It does not specify the type of license (e.g., open, proprietary, etc.).

Vote: 1
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_4.
Request: If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, no, a value of 1 for a license-related measure does not necessarily mean an open license is used.
The primary measure that uses a binary 0/1 output is "R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source".
Its definition is given as:
"output":"1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise"
This means a value of 1 simply indicates that license information was found and is retrievable.
It does not evaluate the type of license (e.g., open like CC-BY, restrictive, or proprietary). It only confirms the presence of license information.

--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_5.
Request: If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided information, yes, a Verifiability score of 1 implies that all the individual metrics that contribute to it have their best possible scores.
The Verifiability score is defined as the "Overall score for the verifiability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores".
The individual metrics for the Verifiability dimension include:
Sources: Stating the author, contributors, publisher, and sources.
Author (metadata): Stating the author in the metadata.
Author (query): Stating the author, retrievable via a query.
Publisher: Stating the publisher.
Contributor: Stating the contributors.
Signed: Checking if the dataset is signed.
Therefore, a perfect score of 1 indicates that the dataset is signed and that information regarding its sources, author, publisher, and contributors is available.

Vote: 1
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_5.
Request: If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided information, a verifiability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that all provider information is available, but it does mean that the dataset has achieved the highest possible score for the specific metrics that are measured.
Here's the breakdown:
Definition of Verifiability Score: The score is defined as an "Overall score for the verifiability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores." Its best value is 1.
Individual Verifiability Metrics: The metrics that contribute to this score are those with the dimension "Verifiability":
Sources: Checks for the author, contributors, publisher, and sources.
Author (query): Checks for the author via a SPARQL endpoint.
Publisher: Checks for the publisher via a SPARQL endpoint or VoID file.
Contributor: Checks for contributors via a SPARQL endpoint or VoID file.
Author (metadata): Checks for the author in a VoID file or metadata.
Signed: Checks if the dataset is digitally signed.
Therefore, a score of 1 indicates a perfect score across this specific set of metrics, strongly suggesting that information about authors, publishers, contributors, and sources is present and that the dataset may be signed.
