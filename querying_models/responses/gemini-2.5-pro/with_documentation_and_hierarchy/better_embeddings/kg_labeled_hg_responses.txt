Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the availability score for the DBLP dataset is 1.00 (as recorded on 2025-07-13 and 2025-08-03) because it scores perfectly on the key metrics that contribute to this overall score.
The "Availability score" is defined as a combination of individual availability metrics. For the DBLP dataset (dblp-kg), these metrics are excellent:
SPARQL Endpoint: The dataset has an "Available" SPARQL endpoint.
{"14674":["2025-07-13","Available","Sparql endpoint",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
RDF Dump Availability: The RDF dump containing the metadata is fully available for download, scoring 1.00.
{"14675":["1.000000","2025-07-13","Availability of RDF dump (metadata)",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
{"14780":["1.000000","2025-07-13","Availability for download (metadata)",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
Working Access Points: The FAIR metric "A1-D Working access point(s)" also receives a perfect score of 1.00, confirming that its access methods are operational.
{"14859":["1.000000","2025-07-13","A1-D Working access point(s)",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
Performance: The dataset achieves a perfect "Performance score" of 1.00, indicating high performance in areas like latency and throughput.
{"14825":["1.000000","2025-07-13","Performance score",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
In summary, the combination of having a working SPARQL endpoint, a readily downloadable RDF dump, and excellent performance results in a perfect availability score of 1.00.

Vote: 1
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the DBLP dataset (labeled dblp-kg) achieves a perfect availability score of 1.0 because it meets several key criteria for data accessibility.
Specifically, on dates like July 13, 2025, the data shows:
SPARQL Endpoint: The dataset is available through a working SPARQL endpoint at https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql.
Downloadable RDF Dump: The metadata is fully available for download as an RDF dump, with the URLs https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples and https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz provided.
High FAIR Accessibility Metrics: It scores 1.0 on FAIR principles related to accessibility, such as "A1-M Metadata availability via working primary sources" and "A1-D Working access point(s)".
The combination of providing both a queryable endpoint (SPARQL) and a complete downloadable file (RDF dump) leads to its perfect availability score.

Vote: 1
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_2.
Request: Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided data, a score of 0 for "Amount of data score" does not necessarily mean the dataset is empty, but it indicates a very low amount of data or that the metrics used to calculate the score could not be retrieved.
Here is the definition provided in the file:
Amount of data score: "Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores".
This score is derived from other metrics within the "Amount of data" dimension, such as:
Number of triples
Number of entities
Number of properties
A score of 0 would mean that the values for these individual metrics were either zero or could not be retrieved (e.g., if a SPARQL endpoint was missing or offline).

Vote: 1
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_2.
Request: If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided information, an amount-of-data score of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data.
Here's why:
The "Amount of data score" is a combination of scores from individual metrics like "Number of triples (query)", "Number of entities", and "Number of property".
These individual metrics are calculated using inputs such as a "(working) SPARQL endpoint" or a "VoID file".
If these inputs are missing or inaccessible (e.g., the SPARQL endpoint is missing), the metrics cannot be calculated. The output for these metrics in such cases is "-", which would likely result in a metric score of 0.
Therefore, a dataset could exist (for example, as a downloadable file), but if it doesn't have a working SPARQL endpoint or a VoID file for the system to analyze, the individual metrics would fail, leading to an overall "Amount of data score" of 0.

Vote: 1
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_3.
Request: When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, no, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working.
Here is an example from the data:
For the dataset dblp-kg on 2025-07-13:
The Availability score is 1.000000.
{"14822":["1.000000","2025-07-13","Availability score",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
The Sparql endpoint is "Available".
{"14674":["2025-07-13","Available","Sparql endpoint",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
However, the Availability of RDF dump (query) is "False", which means the dump was offline.
{"14775":["2025-07-13","Availability of RDF dump (query)","False",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
This shows that a dataset can have a perfect availability score of 1 even when only the SPARQL endpoint is working and the RDF dump is offline.

Vote: 0
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_3.
Request: if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up.
Here is the evidence from the file:
The dataset dblp-kg consistently has an "Availability score" of 1.0, even when its RDF dump is reported as offline.
For example, on the date 2025-08-03:
{"24872":["1.000000","2025-08-03","Availability score",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]} -> The score is 1.0.
{"24724":["2025-08-03","Available","Sparql endpoint",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]} -> The SPARQL endpoint is Available.
{"24825":["2025-08-03","Availability of RDF dump (query)","False",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]} -> The RDF dump is False (offline).
This shows that a perfect availability score can be achieved with just a working SPARQL endpoint, even if the data dump is not available for download.

Vote: 0
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_4.
Request: if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, no, a value of 1 for the license measure does not necessarily mean that an open license is used.
Here's the specific definition from the file:
{"R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source":{"type":"measure","description":"Any license retrievable","input":"(Meta)data","output":"1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise","dimension":"FAIR"}}
This definition clarifies that a value of 1 means a "license explicitly reported".
It checks for the presence of license information, not the type of license (e.g., open, proprietary, etc.). A dataset could have a very restrictive, non-open license that is clearly stated, and it would still receive a score of 1 for this measure.

Vote: 1
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_4.
Request: If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, no, a value of "1" for the license measure does not necessarily mean that an open license is used.
According to the definition in the file, the value "1" simply means that a license was found and is retrievable.
Here is the specific definition from the text:
code
JSON
{"R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source":{"type":"measure","description":"Any license retrievable","input":"(Meta)data","output":"1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise","dimension":"FAIR"}}
This shows that a value of "1" indicates that a "license [is] explicitly reported," but it does not specify the type of license.

Question: E&D_5.
Request: If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, a Verifiability score of 1 indicates that the individual metrics contributing to this score have achieved their best possible values.
The Verifiability score is defined as an "Overall score for the verifiability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores."
The metrics that belong to the "Verifiability" dimension and relate to provider information are:
Sources: Stating the author, contributors, publisher, and sources.
Author (metadata): Stating the author in the metadata.
Author (query): Stating the author, retrievable via a SPARQL query.
Publisher: Stating the publisher.
Contributor: Stating the contributors.
Therefore, a score of 1 implies that information for these provider-related metrics is indicated. The score also includes the Signed metric, which checks if the dataset is signed.

Vote: 1
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_5.
Request: If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, a verifiability score of 1 implies that the provider information checked by the individual verifiability metrics is available.
Here's the breakdown from the file:
Verifiability score definition: It is defined as an "Overall score for the verifiability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores," with 1 being the best value.
Individual Verifiability Metrics: The file lists several metrics that contribute to this score, all of which relate to provider information:
Sources: Checks for the author, contributors, publisher, and sources.
Author (query): Checks if the author is indicated via a SPARQL endpoint.
Publisher: Checks if the publisher is indicated.
Author (metadata): Checks if the author is indicated in metadata.
Contributor: Checks if contributors are indicated.
Signed: Checks if the dataset is signed.
Since the overall score is a combination of these individual metrics, achieving the best possible score of 1 would mean that the information checked by these metrics (author, publisher, contributors, sources, etc.) is present.
