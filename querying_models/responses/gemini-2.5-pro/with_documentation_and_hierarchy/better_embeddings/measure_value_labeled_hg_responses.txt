Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the availability score for the DBLP dataset is 1.0 because it scores perfectly on the key individual metrics that contribute to this overall score.
The "Availability score" is defined as a composite score computed from individual availability metrics. For the DBLP dataset, these metrics show high availability:
SPARQL Endpoint: The dataset has a consistently available SPARQL endpoint.
{"Available":["Sparql endpoint","2025-05-04","dblp-kg"]}
{"Available":["2025-07-13","dblp-kg","Sparql endpoint"]}
{"Available":["2025-08-03","dblp-kg","Sparql endpoint"]}
RDF Dump Download: The dataset provides a downloadable RDF dump, which is confirmed by a score of 1.0 for "Availability of RDF dump (metadata)".
{"1.000000":["dblp-kg","Availability for download (metadata)","2025-07-13"]}
{"1.000000":["Availability for download (metadata)","dblp-kg","2025-08-03"]}
Download URLs: Concrete URLs for downloading the dataset are provided.
{"['https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples'. 'https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz']":["2025-07-13","dblp-kg","URL for download the dataset"]}
Working Access Points: The dataset scores 1.0 for the FAIR metric "A1-D Working access point(s)", which confirms it has an operational SPARQL endpoint and/or an accessible data dump.
{"1.000000":["2025-05-04","dblp-kg","A1-D Working access point(s)"]}
{"1.000000":["2025-08-03","A1-D Working access point(s)","dblp-kg"]}
In summary, the DBLP dataset achieves a perfect availability score of 1.0 because it is accessible through both a working SPARQL endpoint and downloadable data dumps.

Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the DBLP dataset (dblp-kg) achieved a perfect availability score of 1.0 on 2025-07-13 and 2025-08-03. This score is based on several contributing factors that indicate high accessibility:
SPARQL Endpoint: The dataset has an "Available" SPARQL endpoint.
Metadata Download: The metadata is available for download, with Availability for download (metadata) and Availability of RDF dump (metadata) both scoring 1.0.
Working Access Points: The dataset has working primary sources for both its data and metadata, as shown by the A1-D Working access point(s) and A1-M Metadata availability via working primary sources metrics, which are both 1.0.

Vote: 1
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_2.
Request: Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided information, a score of 0 for "Amount of data score" does not necessarily mean the dataset is empty, but it does represent the worst possible score for that dimension.
Here's the breakdown from the text:
Definition: The "Amount of data score" is described as an "Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores".
Input: Its input is the scores from other metrics, such as "Number of triples (query)" and "Number of entities".
Output: The score is a value between [0,1], where 1 is the best value.
Therefore, a score of 0 indicates that the underlying metrics (like the number of triples, entities, etc.) either returned a value of zero or could not be computed, resulting in the lowest possible score for this combined dimension.

Vote: 1
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_2.
Request: If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided information, an amount-of-data score of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data.
Here's why:
The "Amount of data score" is a combination of scores from individual metrics like "Number of triples (query)", "Number of entities", and "Number of property".
These individual metrics are calculated using inputs such as a "(working) SPARQL endpoint" or a "VoID file".
If these inputs are missing or inaccessible (e.g., the SPARQL endpoint is missing), the metrics cannot be calculated. The output for these metrics in such cases is "-", which would likely result in a metric score of 0.
Therefore, a dataset could exist (for example, as a downloadable file), but if it doesn't have a working SPARQL endpoint or a VoID file for the system to analyze, the individual metrics would fail, leading to an overall "Amount of data score" of 0.

--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_3.
Request: When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, no, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working.
Here is an example from the data:
For the dataset dblp-kg on 2025-07-13:
The Availability score is 1.000000.
{"14822":["1.000000","2025-07-13","Availability score",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
The Sparql endpoint is "Available".
{"14674":["2025-07-13","Available","Sparql endpoint",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
However, the Availability of RDF dump (query) is "False", which means the dump was offline.
{"14775":["2025-07-13","Availability of RDF dump (query)","False",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
This shows that a dataset can have a perfect availability score of 1 even when only the SPARQL endpoint is working and the RDF dump is offline.

Vote: 0
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_3.
Request: if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up.
Here is the evidence from the file:
The dataset dblp-kg consistently has an "Availability score" of 1.0, even when its RDF dump is reported as offline.
For example, on the date 2025-08-03:
{"24872":["1.000000","2025-08-03","Availability score",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]} -> The score is 1.0.
{"24724":["2025-08-03","Available","Sparql endpoint",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]} -> The SPARQL endpoint is Available.
{"24825":["2025-08-03","Availability of RDF dump (query)","False",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]} -> The RDF dump is False (offline).
This shows that a perfect availability score can be achieved with just a working SPARQL endpoint, even if the data dump is not available for download.

Question: E&D_4.
Request: if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, no, a value of 1 for the license measure does not necessarily mean that an open license is used.
Here's the specific definition from the file:
{"R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source":{"type":"measure","description":"Any license retrievable","input":"(Meta)data","output":"1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise","dimension":"FAIR"}}
This definition clarifies that a value of 1 means a "license explicitly reported".
It checks for the presence of license information, not the type of license (e.g., open, proprietary, etc.). A dataset could have a very restrictive, non-open license that is clearly stated, and it would still receive a score of 1 for this measure.

Vote: 1
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_4.
Request: If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, no, a value of "1" for the license measure does not necessarily mean that an open license is used.
According to the definition in the file, the value "1" simply means that a license was found and is retrievable.
Here is the specific definition from the text:
code
JSON
{"R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source":{"type":"measure","description":"Any license retrievable","input":"(Meta)data","output":"1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise","dimension":"FAIR"}}
This shows that a value of "1" indicates that a "license [is] explicitly reported," but it does not specify the type of license.

Question: E&D_5.
Request: If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided text, a Verifiability score of 1 does not mean that only information about providers is set, but it does imply that the provider information is set, in addition to other verifiability metrics.
Here's the breakdown from the file:
Verifiability score definition: It is an "Overall score for the verifiability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores".
Individual Verifiability Metrics: The metrics listed with the dimension "Verifiability" are:
Sources
Author (metadata)
Author (query)
Publisher
Contributor
Signed
Since the overall score is a combination of these individual scores, a perfect score of 1 would mean that all the contributing metrics also have perfect scores. This includes not only the provider information (Author, Publisher, Contributor, Sources) but also whether the dataset is Signed.

Vote: 1
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_5.
Request: If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?
Expected Response: Yes
