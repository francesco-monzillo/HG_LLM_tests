Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the availability score for the DBLP dataset is 1.00 (or very close to it) because the primary methods of accessing its data are consistently online and functional.
The "Availability score" is described as a combination of individual availability metrics. For the DBLP dataset, these key metrics consistently have the best possible values:
SPARQL Endpoint: The SPARQL endpoint is consistently reported as "Available".
{"14071":["Sparql endpoint","Available","2025-07-13","dblp-kg"]}
{"24121":["dblp-kg","Available","2025-08-03","Sparql endpoint"]}
Metadata Availability: The dataset is available for download via its metadata, scoring a perfect 1.0.
{"14177":["dblp-kg","Availability for download (metadata)","2025-07-13","1.000000"]}
{"24227":["Availability for download (metadata)","dblp-kg","1.000000","2025-08-03"]}
RDF Dump: An RDF dump of the metadata is also available, scoring 1.0.
{"14072":["2025-07-13","dblp-kg","Availability of RDF dump (metadata)","1.000000"]}
{"24122":["2025-08-03","Availability of RDF dump (metadata)","1.000000","dblp-kg"]}
No Inactive Links: On the dates when the score is 1.0, there are no inactive links found.
{"14174":["2025-07-13","dblp-kg","Inactive links","False"]}
{"24224":["False","2025-08-03","dblp-kg","Inactive links"]}
In summary, the DBLP dataset achieves a perfect or near-perfect availability score because its main access points (SPARQL endpoint and metadata/RDF dumps) are operational and accessible.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response: Based on the provided data, the DBLP dataset (dblp-kg) has an availability score of 1.0 on multiple dates (e.g., 2025-07-13 and 2025-08-03) due to the following reasons:
Available SPARQL Endpoint: The dataset has a consistently "Available" SPARQL endpoint at https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql.
Metadata Download: The metadata is fully available for download, with the "Availability for download (metadata)" and "Availability of RDF dump (metadata)" measures both scoring 1.0.
Download URLs Provided: There are explicit URLs for downloading the dataset, such as https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples and https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz.

--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_2.
Request: Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided data, a score of 0 for "Amount of data score" does not necessarily mean the dataset is empty, but rather that the amount of data could not be successfully measured.
Here's the breakdown from the file:
Definition of the Score: The "Amount of data score" is defined as an "Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores".
Contributing Metrics: The individual metrics for the "Amount of data" dimension include:
Number of triples (query)
Number of entities
Number of property
Reasoning: For the combined score to be 0, the scores for all the individual contributing metrics would have to be 0. This can happen in two scenarios:
The dataset is actually empty (e.g., it has 0 triples, 0 entities, 0 properties).
The metrics could not be retrieved. For example, the description for Number of triples (query) states its output is "-" if "The SPARQL endpoint is missing." A missing value would contribute 0 to the overall score.
Therefore, a score of 0 indicates that no data was quantified, which could be because the dataset is empty or because the necessary access points (like a working SPARQL endpoint or VoID file) were unavailable to measure its size.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_2.
Request: If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided file, an "Amount of data score" of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data.
Here's why:
It's a calculated score: The "Amount of data score" is defined as an "Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores."
It depends on multiple metrics: This score is derived from other metrics in the "Amount of data" dimension, such as "Number of triples (query)," "Number of entities," and "Number of property."
A low score doesn't mean zero data: A score of 0 would mean the combined, weighted value of these individual metrics is 0. This could happen if the values for the underlying metrics are very low or could not be retrieved (e.g., the SPARQL endpoint is missing or returns an error), not necessarily because the dataset is empty.
For example, the w3c-wordnet dataset has a low score of 0.333333, but the file also shows it has 710000.000000 triples. This demonstrates that a low score does not equate to having no data.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_3.
Request: When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working.
Here is the evidence from the file:
The dataset dblp-kg has an "Availability score" of 1.000000 on the date 2025-08-03.
{"24269":["Availability score","1.000000","2025-08-03","dblp-kg"]}
On that same date, its "Sparql endpoint" was "Available".
{"24121":["dblp-kg","Available","2025-08-03","Sparql endpoint"]}
However, the "Availability of RDF dump (query)" for the same dataset and date was "False", meaning the dump was offline or not downloadable.
{"24222":["Availability of RDF dump (query)","dblp-kg","2025-08-03","False"]}
This example shows that a dataset can have a perfect availability score of 1 even when only the SPARQL endpoint is working and the RDF dump is not.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_3.
Request: if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are online.
The Availability score is defined as an "Overall score for the availability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual availability metrics scores." This means it's a composite value.
Let's look at the data for the dataset dblp-kg on 2025-08-03:
Availability score: 1.000000 {"24269":["Availability score","1.000000","2025-08-03","dblp-kg"]}
Sparql endpoint: Available {"24121":["dblp-kg","Available","2025-08-03","Sparql endpoint"]}
Availability of RDF dump (query): False {"24222":["Availability of RDF dump (query)","dblp-kg","2025-08-03","False"]}
In this case, the dataset dblp-kg has a perfect availability score of 1, and its SPARQL endpoint is available.
However, the check for its RDF dump (Availability of RDF dump (query)) returned "False," indicating the dump was offline. This shows that a perfect score can be achieved even if one of the access methods is down.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_4.
Request: if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, a value of "1.000000" for a license does not necessarily mean that an open license is used.
It refers to the measure "R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source". The description for this measure is:
code
JSON
{
  "R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source": {
    "type": "measure",
    "description": "Any license retrievable",
    "input": "(Meta)data",
    "output": "1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise",
    "dimension": "FAIR"
  }
}
This means a value of 1 simply indicates that a license was explicitly reported and found, not that the license itself is an open one.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_4.
Request: If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, no, a value of "1" for a license measure does not necessarily mean that an open license is used.
The measure R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source is defined as follows:
Description: "Any license retrievable"
Output: "1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise"
This means a value of "1" only indicates that a license was found and is retrievable. It does not evaluate the terms of the license itself to determine if it is open or restrictive.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_5.
Request: If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided information, a Verifiability score of 1 indicates that the dataset has achieved the best possible score on the individual metrics that make up the verifiability dimension.
The Verifiability score is defined as an "Overall score for the verifiability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores".
These individual metrics include measures related to providers, such as:
Sources: Stating the author, contributors, publisher, and sources.
Author (metadata): Stating the author in the metadata.
Author (query): Stating the author via a SPARQL query.
Publisher: Stating the publisher.
Contributor: Stating the contributors.
Therefore, a score of 1 implies that information about the providers (authors, contributors, publishers, sources) is available and has been indicated.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_5.
Request: If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided information, the answer is yes.
The "Verifiability score" is described as the "Overall score for the verifiability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores," with 1 being the best value.
The individual metrics that contribute to this score (i.e., those in the "Verifiability" dimension) are all related to provider information. For example, the "Sources" metric is for "stating the author and his contributors, the publisher of the data and its sources." Other metrics in this dimension include "Author", "Publisher", and "Contributor".
Therefore, a perfect score of 1 implies that the individual metrics related to provider information also have their best possible scores, meaning that the information is available.
--------------------------------------------------
