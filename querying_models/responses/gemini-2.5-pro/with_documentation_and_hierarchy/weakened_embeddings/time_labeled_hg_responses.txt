Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the "Availability score" is a composite measure defined as the "Overall score for the availability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual availability metrics scores".
The score for the DBLP dataset is 1 on dates like 2025-07-13 and 2025-08-03 because it performs perfectly on the key individual availability metrics.
Specifically, on 2025-08-03, the following metrics contribute to the perfect score:
SPARQL Endpoint: The SPARQL endpoint is listed as "Available".
RDF Dump: The dataset has a perfect score of 1.000000 for "Availability of RDF dump (metadata)" and "Availability for download (metadata)".
Download URLs: There are working URLs provided for downloading the dataset: ['https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples', 'https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz'].
Link Status: The "Inactive links" metric is "False", meaning no broken links were detected.
FAIR Metrics: It scores 1.000000 on related FAIR metrics such as "A1-D Working access point(s)" and "A1-M Metadata availability via working primary sources".
The combination of having an accessible SPARQL endpoint, a downloadable RDF dump, and no broken links results in a perfect availability score of 1.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the DBLP dataset (dblp-kg) has an availability score of 1.0 (as seen on dates like 2025-07-13 and 2025-08-03) because it is highly accessible through multiple methods:
Available RDF Dump: The dataset is available for download as an RDF dump, which is confirmed by a score of 1.0 for the "Availability of RDF dump (metadata)" metric. The specific download URLs are provided: https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples and https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz.
Available SPARQL Endpoint: The dataset is also accessible via a SPARQL endpoint. The data indicates that a "Sparql endpoint" is "Available" and provides the URL: https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql.
The combination of having both a downloadable data dump and a queryable SPARQL endpoint results in a perfect score for metrics like "A1-D Working access point(s)" and contributes to the overall availability score of 1.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_2.
Request: Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided data, a score of 0 for "Amount of data score" does not necessarily mean the dataset is empty.
Here's the reasoning:
The "Amount of data score" is not a direct count of triples but a computed measure. Its definition is:
"Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores"
The individual metrics that feed into this score include:
Number of triples (query)
Number of entities
Number of property
The definitions for these individual metrics state that if the information cannot be retrieved (e.g., "The SPARQL endpoint is missing"), the output is "-". Therefore, a final score of 0 could mean that the underlying metrics were 0 (an empty dataset) or that the information was unavailable to be measured.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_2.
Request: If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided information, no, an "Amount of data score" of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data.
The "Amount of data score" is defined as an "Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores".
This means it is a calculated, composite score, not a direct count of triples or entities. A score of 0 would be the lowest possible value on this calculated dimension, but it could result from the underlying metrics (like "Number of triples", "Number of entities", "Number of property") being zero, very low, or simply unobtainable (e.g., if a SPARQL endpoint is missing).
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_3.
Request: When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working.
Here is the evidence from the dataset dblp-kg on the date 2025-08-03:
Availability Score: {"24470":["1.000000","Availability score","dblp-kg",{"label":"2025-08-03"}]}
SPARQL Endpoint Status: {"24322":["Available","Sparql endpoint","dblp-kg",{"label":"2025-08-03"}]}
RDF Dump Status (from query): {"24423":["Availability of RDF dump (query)","False","dblp-kg",{"label":"2025-08-03"}]}
In this case, dblp-kg received a perfect availability score of 1.0, even though its SPARQL endpoint was "Available" but its RDF dump was found to be offline ("False") by the query-based measure.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_3.
Request: if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up.
The Availability score is defined as an "Overall score for the availability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual availability metrics scores." This means it's a composite score, and having one highly available access method could potentially result in a perfect score even if another is offline.
A clear example from the data is the dblp-kg dataset on 2025-08-03:
Availability score: {"24470":["1.000000","Availability score","dblp-kg",{"label":"2025-08-03"}]} -> 1.0
Sparql endpoint: {"24322":["Available","Sparql endpoint","dblp-kg",{"label":"2025-08-03"}]} -> Available
Availability of RDF dump (query): {"24423":["Availability of RDF dump (query)","False","dblp-kg",{"label":"2025-08-03"}]} -> False (offline)
This shows that dblp-kg achieved a perfect availability score of 1.0 while its SPARQL endpoint was available but its RDF dump was offline.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_4.
Request: if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided file, no, a value of 1 for a license measure does not necessarily mean that an open license is used.
The file defines the measure R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source as follows:
code
JSON
{"R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source":{"type":"measure","description":"Any license retrievable","input":"(Meta)data","output":"1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise","dimension":"FAIR"}}
According to this definition, a value of 1 simply means that a license was "explicitly reported" and is retrievable. It does not evaluate whether the license is open or restrictive.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_4.
Request: If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, no, a license value of 1 does not necessarily mean that an open license is used.
The value 1.000000 is associated with the measure "R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source". The definition for this measure is given as:
code
JSON
"R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source":{
  "type":"measure",
  "description":"Any license retrievable",
  "input":"(Meta)data",
  "output":"1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise",
  "dimension":"FAIR"
}
This indicates that a value of 1 simply means that a license was "explicitly reported" and retrievable, not that the license itself is an open one. The measure checks for the presence of license information, not the specific terms of the license.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_5.
Request: If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided file, yes, a Verifiability score of 1 implies that all the individual metrics contributing to it have achieved their best possible values.
The Verifiability score is defined as the "Overall score for the verifiability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores," with the best value being 1.
The individual metrics that belong to the "Verifiability" dimension are:
Author (metadata)
Author (query)
Publisher
Contributor
Sources
Signed
Therefore, for the combined score to be 1, these individual metrics related to provider information must be fully and correctly set.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_5.
Request: If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, yes, a verifiability score of 1 would indicate that provider information is available.
The "Verifiability score" is defined as the "Overall score for the verifiability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores". The best possible value is 1.
The metrics that contribute to this score (those with the dimension "Verifiability") are directly related to provider information, including:
Sources: "stating the author and his contributors, the publisher of the data and its sources"
Author (query): "stating the author and his contributors, the publisher of the data and its sources"
Publisher: "stating the author and his contributors, the publisher of the data and its sources"
Contributor: "stating the author and his contributors, the publisher of the data and its sources"
Author (metadata): "stating the author and his contributors, the publisher of the data and its sources"
Since a score of 1 is the best value, it implies that these individual metrics for author, publisher, and contributor information have been successfully met.
--------------------------------------------------
