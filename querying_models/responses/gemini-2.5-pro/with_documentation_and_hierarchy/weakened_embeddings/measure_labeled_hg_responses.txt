However, monitoring data from May and September 2025 shows a SPARQL endpoint availability score of 1.00, indicating it was fully operational at the time of those measurements.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: TA_3
Request: Is the data dump of the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset always set to 1 in the observed period?
Expected Response: No, it is discontinuous
Response:
No, the raw RDF dump availability for the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset was not always set to 1 during the observed period.

On September 7, 2025, the value for RDF dump availability was 0.00. Prior to that date, it was consistently 1.00 on May 4, 2025, June 1, 2025, July 6, 2025, and August 3, 2025.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: TA_3
Request: Is the data dump of the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset always up?
Expected Response: No, it is discontinuous
Response:
Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively say whether the data dump of the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset is always up to date.

Here's what the data indicates:

Update Frequency: The dataset has a specified monthly update frequency.

No Guarantee of Real-Time Updates: While there is a monthly update schedule, this does not guarantee that the data dump is always current in real-time. There may be periods between updates where the dump does not reflect the absolute latest information.

Offline Dumps Available: The dataset is available for download via offline dumps at the following FTP locations: ftp://ftp.dbcls.jp/allie/allie_rdf/allie_rdf_nt_latest.gz and ftp://ftp.dbcls.jp/allie/allie_rdf/. The filename allie_rdf_nt_latest.gz suggests that it is intended to be the most recent version.

In conclusion, while there is a regular update schedule, the term "always up" is absolute. The data is updated monthly, so it is periodically brought up to date, but it is not continuously updated in real-time.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: TA_4.
Request: Is the accuracy of NoiPA constant over time?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Yes, based on the provided data, the accuracy of NoiPA has been constant over time.

The accuracy score for NoiPA was recorded on three different dates, and on each occasion, the score was 1.00.

Here are the specific data points:

The longest continuous period in which the RDF data dump for the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset was available (indicated by a value of "1.00") is 91 days, from May 4, 2025, to August 3, 2025.

The availability of the RDF dump was recorded as "1.00" on the following dates:

May 4, 2025

June 1, 2025

July 6, 2025

August 3, 2025

The continuous period of availability ended on September 7, 2025, when the value changed to "0.00".
--------------------------------------------------
Question TA_5.
Request: For how long, without interruption, has the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset data dump remained up?
Expected Response: 91 days
Response:
Based on the available information, the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset data dump has not remained up without interruption.

Evidence from the provided data indicates a change in the availability of the RDF dump. On August 3, 2025, the "RDF dump availability raw" was recorded as "1.00", signifying it was available. However, on a later check, dated September 7, 2025, the same metric was "0.00", indicating it was no longer available.
This shows that there was an interruption in the availability of the data dump between these two dates.

--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the availability score for the DBLP dataset is 1.00 because it meets several key criteria for data accessibility, each receiving a perfect score.
Specifically, the dataset:
Has a downloadable RDF dump: The "Availability of RDF dump (metadata)" and "Availability for download (metadata)" scores are both 1.00.
Provides a SPARQL endpoint: The "Sparql endpoint" is listed as "Available".
Maintains working access points: The FAIR metric "A1-D Working access point(s)" has a score of 1.00.
Makes metadata available: The FAIR metric "A1-M Metadata availability via working primary sources" also has a score of 1.00.
Supports secure access: The "A1.2 Authentication & HTTPS support" score is 1.00.
The combination of these factors, indicating that the data is readily accessible through multiple, standard, and secure methods, results in a perfect availability score of 1.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the DBLP dataset has a high availability score, which is 1.00 on multiple evaluation dates (e.g., 2025-07-13 and 2025-08-03), because it meets several key criteria for accessibility:
Multiple Access Methods: The dataset is available through a primary URL (https://dblp.org), downloadable files, and a SPARQL endpoint (https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql).
Downloadable RDF Dumps: The metadata is fully available for download, as indicated by the "Availability of RDF dump (metadata)" score of 1.00.
No Authentication Required: The data shows that the dataset does not require authentication for access ("Requires authentication": "False").
High FAIR Accessibility Score: It achieves a perfect score of 1.00 on several FAIR accessibility metrics, including:
A1-M Metadata availability via working primary sources
A1-D Working access point(s)
A1.2 Authentication & HTTPS support
These factors combine to give it a perfect FAIR "A score" of 1.00, which is the main contributor to its overall availability score.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_2.
Request: Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided data, a score of 0 for "Amount of data" does not necessarily mean the dataset is empty.
Here's the evidence from the file:
The dataset micro-coronavirus has a "Completeness score" of 0.000000, but its "Amount of data score" is 0.666667, and it contains 7,362,083 labels/comments.
The dataset dblp-kg has a "Completeness score" of 0.000000, but its "Amount of data score" is 0.333333, and it contains over 140 million labels/comments.
The dataset bpr has a "Completeness score" of 0.000000, but its "Amount of data score" is 0.666667, and it has 366,800 triples in its metadata.
While there are no examples of a dataset with an "Amount of data score" of exactly 0, the fact that other scores can be 0 for datasets that clearly contain a large amount of data indicates that a score of 0 does not mean the dataset is empty.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_2.
Request: If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided data, an "Amount of data score" of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data.
Here's why:
The "Amount of data score" appears to be a calculated metric rather than a direct count of triples or data points.
For instance, the micro-coronavirus dataset has a "Completeness score" of 0.000000, but it also has an "Amount of data score" of 0.666667 and a "Number of triples (metadata)" of 70,870,184.000000.
This shows that a score of 0 in one metric does not mean the dataset is empty. It is more likely that a score of 0 for the "Amount of data score" would indicate that the dataset's size did not meet a certain threshold or that the information required to calculate the score was not available, rather than indicating a complete absence of data.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_3.
Request: When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, no, an availability score of 1 does not mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working.
For example, for the dblp-kg dataset on August 3, 2025:
The Availability score is 1.000000 (chunk 24671).
The Sparql endpoint is "Available" (chunk 24523).
However, the Availability of RDF dump (query) is "False" (chunk 24624).
This shows that a dataset can have an availability score of 1 even if only the SPARQL endpoint is working and the data dump is not.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_3.
Request: if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the data provided, no, an availability score of 1 does not guarantee that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are available.
For example, for the dblp-kg dataset on 2025-07-13:
The Availability score is "1.000000" (14621).
The Sparql endpoint is "Available" (14473).
However, the Availability of RDF dump (query) is "False" (14574).
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_4.
Request: if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, a value of "1" for a license-related metric does not automatically mean an open license is used, but it generally indicates a positive outcome in finding a license.
Here's a breakdown of what a value of "1" typically means for different license-related labels in your file:
For "R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable...": A value of 1.000000 means that a license was successfully found and is retrievable. It's a boolean check for the existence and accessibility of a license, not an evaluation of whether the license is open.
For "_machine_readable_license_metadata_is_retrievable": A value of 1.000000 indicates that a machine-readable license was successfully found in the metadata.
For "Licensing score": A value of 1.000000 (seen for the micro-coronavirus dataset) represents a perfect score, which strongly implies that a clear, open license is in place. A score of 0.500000 (seen for bpr, dblp-kg, etc.) suggests partial success.
To confirm if a license is open, you should look at the entries with the label "License machine redeable (metadata)" or "License machine redeable (query)". These fields provide the actual URL of the license found.
For example, the data shows licenses like:
http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-zero
https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by-sa
These are all well-known open licenses.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_4.
Request: If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, the meaning of "license is set to 1" depends on the specific metric being measured.
Here's a breakdown:
For availability metrics: When the label is something like "R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable..." or "_machine_readable_license_metadata_is_retrievable", a value of 1.000000 means that the license information was successfully found and is available. It does not, by itself, specify whether the license is open or not.
For the "Licensing score" metric: A score of 1.000000 appears to indicate that an open license is used and all related availability checks were passed. For example, the micro-coronavirus dataset has a "Licensing score" of 1 and the data shows it uses an open license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
In conclusion, a value of 1 for a metric like "Licensing score" strongly implies that an open license is used. However, for a simple availability check, it only confirms that license information is present and retrievable.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_5.
Request: If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, a "Verifiability score" of 1 (the best possible value) indicates that the individual metrics contributing to it have achieved their best scores.
The "Verifiability score" is described as an "Overall score for the verifiability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores".
The individual metrics for the "Verifiability" dimension include:
Author (metadata)
Author (query)
Publisher
Contributor
Sources
Signed
Therefore, a verifiability score of 1 implies that all of this information about the providers (author, publisher, contributors, sources) is indicated and present.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_5.
Request: If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided text, a verifiability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that all provider information is available, but rather that the dataset has achieved the best possible score for the specific metrics that are combined to create the score.
Here's the breakdown from the text:
Definition of Verifiability score: It is an "Overall score for the verifiability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores".
Contributing Metrics: The metrics that belong to the "Verifiability" dimension are:
Sources
Author (query)
Publisher
Author (metadata)
Contributor
Signed
A score of 1 is the best possible value, which implies that the dataset scored perfectly on the combination of these specific metrics.
This means that information about the author, publisher, contributors, and sources was found, and the dataset was signed.
--------------------------------------------------
