Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the "Availability score" is a composite measure calculated from several individual availability metrics. For the DBLP dataset (dblp-kg), the score is 1.000000 on dates like 2025-07-13 and 2025-08-03 because it performs perfectly on the key metrics that contribute to this score.
Here is a breakdown of the contributing factors:
SPARQL Endpoint: The dataset has an active and available SPARQL endpoint.
{"14674":["2025-07-13","Available","Sparql endpoint",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
RDF Dump Availability: The metadata for the dataset is available as a downloadable RDF dump, receiving a perfect score.
{"14675":["1.000000","2025-07-13","Availability of RDF dump (metadata)",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
{"14780":["1.000000","2025-07-13","Availability for download (metadata)",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
Performance: The overall performance score, which is a major component of availability, is also perfect. This is based on sub-metrics like latency and throughput.
{"14825":["1.000000","2025-07-13","Performance score",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
{"14701":["1.000000","2025-07-13","_low_latency",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
{"14709":["1.000000","2025-07-13","_high_throughput",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
In summary, the DBLP dataset achieves a perfect availability score of 1 because its SPARQL endpoint is operational, its RDF data dump is accessible for download, and its overall performance is rated as excellent.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the DBLP dataset achieves a perfect availability score of 1.0 on certain dates (e.g., 2025-07-13 and 2025-08-03) due to its excellent accessibility through multiple, working methods.
Here are the key contributing factors:
Multiple Access Points: The dataset is accessible both via a live query endpoint and as a downloadable file.
SPARQL Endpoint: It has a working SPARQL endpoint at https://sparql.dblp.org/sparql.
RDF Dump for Download: It is available for download as an RDF dump, with URLs provided: https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples and https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz.
High Dereferenceability: The dataset consistently scores a perfect 1.0 for "F1-D URIs dereferenceability" on the dates when its availability score is also 1.0, meaning the URIs within the dataset resolve correctly.
No Inactive Links: On the dates with a perfect score, the check for "Inactive links" returns False, confirming that the links provided for access are operational.
In summary, the DBLP dataset earns a top availability score by providing its data through both a SPARQL endpoint and downloadable dumps, ensuring all access links are active and its internal URIs are dereferenceable.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_2.
Request: Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided data, a score of 0 for "Amount of data" does not necessarily mean the dataset is empty, but rather that the metrics used to calculate the score are zero or could not be retrieved.
Here's the breakdown from the file:
Definition of the Score: The "Amount of data score" is described as an "Overall score for the amount of data dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores."
Contributing Metrics: The individual metrics that contribute to this score (those with "dimension":"Amount of data") include:
Number of triples (query)
Number of entities
Number of property
The descriptions for these metrics state that if the values can't be retrieved (e.g., the SPARQL endpoint is missing), the output is "-" instead of an integer. A failure to retrieve any of these values would lead to a score of 0, even if the dataset itself is not empty.
Therefore, an "Amount of data score" of 0 indicates that the system was unable to measure a significant number of triples, entities, or properties, which could be because the dataset is empty or because the data was inaccessible.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_2.
Request: If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided information, an "Amount of data score" of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data.
Here's why:
The "Amount of data score" is described as a "linear combination of the individual amount of data metrics scores."
These individual metrics, such as "Number of triples (query)" or "Number of entities," rely on being able to access a "(working) SPARQL endpoint" or a "VoID file."
The descriptions for these metrics state that if the SPARQL endpoint is missing or an error occurs, the output will be - or None.
Therefore, a score of 0 could indicate that the system was unable to access the dataset's endpoint or metadata to count the triples and entities, not necessarily that the number of triples is zero.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_3.
Request: When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, no, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working.
For example, for the dblp-kg dataset on 2025-07-13, the records show:
Availability score: {"14822":["1.000000","2025-07-13","Availability score",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
Sparql endpoint: {"14674":["2025-07-13","Available","Sparql endpoint",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
Availability of RDF dump (query): {"14775":["2025-07-13","Availability of RDF dump (query)","False",{"label":"dblp-kg"}]}
In this case, the availability score is 1.0, but while the SPARQL endpoint is "Available", the RDF dump is "False" (offline). This indicates that a score of 1 is achieved if at least one of the primary access methods is operational.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_3.
Request: if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, an availability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up.
For example, on 2025-07-13, the dataset dblp-kg has the following values:
Availability score: "1.000000"
Sparql endpoint: "Available"
Availability of RDF dump (query): "False"
This shows that dblp-kg received a perfect availability score even though its RDF dump was offline ("False").
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_4.
Request: if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, the answer is no.
A value of "1" for the measure R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source does not necessarily mean an open license is used.
According to its definition in the file, this measure indicates whether a license is present and reported:
code
JSON
{"R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source":{"type":"measure","description":"Any license retrievable","input":"(Meta)data","output":"1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise","dimension":"FAIR"}}
This means:
1: A license was found and explicitly reported.
0: No license was reported.
The value "1" only confirms the existence of license information, not the type of license (e.g., open, proprietary, restrictive).
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_4.
Request: If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, no, a value of "1" for the license does not necessarily mean that an open license is used.
The measure is defined as:
"R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source":{"type":"measure","description":"Any license retrievable","input":"(Meta)data","output":"1: license explicitly reported; 0: otherwise","dimension":"FAIR"}
This definition indicates that a value of "1" simply means that a license was "explicitly reported" and retrievable. It does not specify anything about the type or openness of that license.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_5.
Request: If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided information, a Verifiability score of 1 does not necessarily mean that all information about providers is set, but it does mean that all metrics within the "Verifiability" dimension have scored perfectly.
Here's a breakdown:
The Verifiability score is defined as an "Overall score for the verifiability dimension computed as a linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores."
The metrics that fall under the Verifiability dimension and relate to providers are:
Author (metadata)
Author (query)
Publisher
Contributor
Sources
Signed
Therefore, a score of 1 would indicate that information for these specific metrics (author, publisher, contributors, sources, and signature) is present and correctly indicated.
However, other provider-related information like Is on a trusted provider list and Trust value are part of the Believability dimension, not the Verifiability dimension. A perfect Verifiability score would not reflect the status of those particular measures.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_5.
Request: If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided file, the Verifiability score is an overall score for the verifiability dimension, calculated as a "linear combination of the individual verifiability metrics scores."
The individual metrics that contribute to this score and are listed under the "Verifiability" dimension are:
Sources: Stating the author, contributors, publisher, and sources.
Author (query): Stating the author via a SPARQL endpoint.
Publisher: Stating the publisher via a SPARQL endpoint or VoID file.
Author (metadata): Stating the author in a VoID file or metadata.
Contributor: Stating the contributors via a SPARQL endpoint or VoID file.
Signed: Checking if the dataset is signed.
Therefore, a verifiability score of 1 (the best possible value) would indicate that the provider information, as measured by these specific metrics (author, publisher, contributors, sources, and signature), is available.
--------------------------------------------------
