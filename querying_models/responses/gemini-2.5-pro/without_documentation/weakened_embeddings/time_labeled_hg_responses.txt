--------------------------------------------------
Question TA_4.
Request: Does the accuracy of NoiPA remain consistent over time?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the information available, the accuracy of NoiPA has not remained consistent over time.

On August 3, 2025, NoiPA had an accuracy score of 1.00. However, by September 7, 2025, the accuracy score had decreased to 1.00, and it remained at 1.00 on May 4, 2025.
This indicates a fluctuation in the accuracy of the NoiPA dataset across different dates.
--------------------------------------------------

Availability: Scored 0.75 for the dblp Knowledge Graph and 0.74 for the Coronavirus dataset.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the _availability_dimension_score for the dblp Knowledge Graph was 1.00 on August 3, 2025. This perfect score is a result of its high performance across three key availability metrics on that date:
SPARQL Endpoint Availability: The _SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw score was 1.00.
RDF Dump Availability: The _RDF_dump_availability_raw score was 1.00.
URI Dereferenceability: The _URIs_dereferenceability_raw score was 1.00.
Since the dataset is fully accessible via its SPARQL endpoint, provides a downloadable RDF dump, and its URIs are successfully dereferenceable, it achieved a perfect score of 1.00 for the availability dimension on that specific day.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the data from August 3, 2025, the dblp Knowledge Graph achieved a perfect availability score of 1.00 because its key availability metrics were all rated at 1.00 on that date:
SPARQL endpoint availability: 1.00
RDF dump availability: 1.00
URI dereferenceability: 1.00
Since the dataset was fully accessible through its SPARQL endpoint, as an RDF dump, and had dereferenceable URIs, it received the maximum score for the availability dimension.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_2.
Request: Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the information provided, a score of 0 for _amount_of_data_dimension_score does not necessarily mean the dataset is empty.
For example, the CIDOC-CRM dataset has a _number_of_triples_in_dataset of 0.00, but its _amount_of_data_dimension_score is 0.33. This indicates that the score is a calculated metric and not a direct representation of the number of triples.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_2.
Request: If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided data, an amount-of-data score of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data. In fact, the opposite appears to be true in one case.
The CIDOC-CRM dataset has a _number_of_triples_in_dataset value of 0.00, but its _amount_of_data_dimension_score is 0.33.
{"10067":["0.00","CIDOC-CRM","_number_of_triples_in_dataset",{"label":"2025-05-04"}]}
{"10152":["0.33","CIDOC-CRM","_amount_of_data_dimension_score",{"label":"2025-05-04"}]}
This indicates that the _amount_of_data_dimension_score is a calculated or categorical score, not a direct measure of the data volume.
A dataset with zero triples can still receive a non-zero score, suggesting it falls into the lowest tier for this particular metric.
To determine if a dataset contains data, you should refer to the _number_of_triples_in_dataset metric directly.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_3.
Request: When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the data provided, no, that is not correct. The availability score is a graded metric that reflects the overall accessibility of the dataset, not just a simple check on whether both a SPARQL endpoint and a data dump are working.
For example, the Coronavirus dataset has a working SPARQL endpoint but no available data dump:
_SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw: 1.00
_RDF_dump_availability_raw: -1.00
This results in an _availability_dimension_score of 0.74, which is less than 1. This demonstrates that having only one of the two access methods available results in a partial score, rather than a simple pass or fail.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_3.
Request: if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the data provided, an availability score of 1.00 does not automatically mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are available.
Here is a counterexample from your data:
The dblp Knowledge Graph on May 4, 2025, had the following values:
_SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw: 1.00 (available)
_RDF_dump_availability_raw: 1.00 (available)
_availability_dimension_score: 0.97
Even though both the endpoint and the dump were available, the score was 0.97, not 1.00.
This indicates that the _availability_dimension_score is a composite metric that likely includes other factors beyond just the raw availability of those two access points.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_4.
Request: if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, the answer is yes, a value of "1.00" for a license-related metric generally indicates that a recognized open license was found.
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
Multiple License Metrics: The data contains several metrics related to licensing, such as _machine_readable_license_metadata, _human_readable_license, and the aggregate _licensing_dimension_score.
Binary Indicators (1.00 or 0.00): For metrics like _machine_readable_license_metadata and _human_readable_license, a value of "1.00" signifies that a valid, machine-parseable license was successfully found. In all such cases in the data, the license found is an open one.
Examples from the Data:
Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science: Has a "1.00" for _machine_readable_license_metadata, and the corresponding raw data (_machine_readable_license_metadata_raw) shows the license is http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by, a Creative Commons Attribution license.
dblp Knowledge Graph: Has a "1.00" for _machine_readable_license_metadata, and the raw data shows the license is http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-zero, a public domain dedication.
Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality: Has a "1.00" for _machine_readable_license_metadata, and the raw data points to the http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/open-government-licence.
In summary, a score of "1.00" on a specific license metric indicates that the check was successful, and the underlying license associated with that success is an open license. However, a dataset might score "1.00" on one metric (e.g., machine-readable) and "0.00" on another (e.g., human-readable) if only one form was found.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_4.
Request: If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, yes, a value of 1.00 for a license-related measure indicates that a known open license is used.
Here is the evidence from the file:
Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science: The _machine_readable_license_metadata is 1.00. The corresponding raw data (_machine_readable_license_metadata_raw) points to http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by, which is a Creative Commons Attribution (open) license.
dblp Knowledge Graph: The _machine_readable_license_metadata is 1.00. The raw data (_machine_readable_license_metadata_raw) points to http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-zero, which is a Creative Commons Zero (public domain dedication) license.
Coronavirus dataset: The _human_readable_license is 1.00. The raw data (_human_readable_license_raw) points to http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/, another Creative Commons Attribution license.
Conversely, when a license is not found, the value is 0.00. For example, for BBC Programmes, the _human_readable_license score is 0.00 because its corresponding _human_readable_license_raw value is None.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_5.
Request: If believability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, a _believability_dimension_score of 1.00 does not necessarily mean that all information about the providers is set.
It appears to be a composite score that is strongly influenced by whether the dataset is on a trusted provider list.
Here is a breakdown of the evidence from the file:
Datasets with a believability score of 1.00:
Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality: Has a _believability_dimension_score of 1.00 and its _is_on_trusted_providers_list value is 1.
Linked Open Camera (LinkedOpenData.it): Has a _believability_dimension_score of 1.00 and its _is_on_trusted_providers_list value is 1.
Counter-examples where believability is less than 1.00, but provider information is available:
dblp Knowledge Graph: Has a _believability_dimension_score of 0.80 and is not on the trusted providers list (_is_on_trusted_providers_list is 0). However, its score for _R1_2_publisher_information_such_as_authors_contributors_publishers_and_sources is 1.00, indicating that publisher information is considered available.
LiLa Lemma Bank: Has a _believability_dimension_score of 0.80 and is not on the trusted providers list. Despite this, its _authors_specified score is 1.00.
In conclusion, the _believability_dimension_score is not a direct measure of the completeness of provider information. While being on a trusted provider list results in a high believability score, a dataset can have a lower score and still provide complete publisher and author information.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_5.
Request: If the believability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, a believability score of 1.00 does not necessarily mean that all provider information is available.
Here's a breakdown using the data:
The Coronavirus dataset has a _believability_dimension_score of 0.80. For this dataset, authors and sources are specified (_authors_specified: 1.00, _sources_specified: 1.00), but publishers and contributors are not (_publishers_specified: 0.00, _contributors_specified: 0.00).
The Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality dataset has a _believability_dimension_score of 1.00. For this dataset, both authors and publishers are specified (_authors_specified: 1.00, _publishers_specified: 1.00).
This suggests that the believability score is an aggregation of several provider-related metrics. A score of 1.00 indicates that the specific metrics used in its calculation (like authors and publishers being specified) are all present, but it does not guarantee that every possible type of provider information (like contributors) is also available.
--------------------------------------------------
