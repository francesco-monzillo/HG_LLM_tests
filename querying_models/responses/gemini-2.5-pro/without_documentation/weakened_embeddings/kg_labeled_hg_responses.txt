Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the availability score for the dblp Knowledge Graph was 1.00 on 2025-08-03.
This score is calculated based on several key metrics that measure how accessible the dataset is. On that date, the dblp dataset achieved a perfect score (1.00) in the following critical areas:
SPARQL Endpoint Availability: The _SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw score was 1.00, indicating the SPARQL endpoint was active and responsive.
RDF Dump Availability: The _RDF_dump_availability_raw score was 1.00, meaning the data dumps were available for download.
URI Dereferenceability: The _URIs_dereferenceability_raw score was 1.00, showing that the URIs within the dataset resolved correctly.
Because the primary methods for accessing the data (both via a live endpoint and through downloadable files) were fully functional, the dataset received a perfect availability dimension score of 1.00.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the dblp Knowledge Graph received an availability score of 1.00 on August 3, 2025. This perfect score is due to its high accessibility through standard, reliable methods.
Specifically, the high score is supported by these key factors:
SPARQL Endpoint Availability: The dataset has a _SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw score of 1.00, indicating that its SPARQL endpoint is consistently available for live queries.
RDF Dump Availability: It also has an _RDF_dump_availability_raw score of 1.00, meaning the complete dataset is available for download.
Direct Download URLs: The _URL_to_download_dataset field provides specific links for the dumps (https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples and https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz), making them easy to access.
URI Dereferenceability: On that date, the _URIs_dereferenceability_raw score was 1.00, showing that the individual URIs within the dataset resolve correctly.
In summary, the combination of a fully operational SPARQL endpoint and the availability of the complete dataset as a downloadable dump leads to its perfect availability score.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_2.
Request: Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided data, a score of 0 for _amount_of_data_dimension_score does not necessarily mean the dataset is empty.
For instance, the CIDOC-CRM dataset has an _amount_of_data_dimension_score of 0.33, but its _number_of_triples_in_dataset is listed as 0.00.
This indicates that the score is not solely based on the number of triples and that a non-zero score can be associated with a dataset reported as having zero triples.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_2.
Request: If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the provided data, an amount-of-data score of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data.
Here's the evidence from the file:
The CIDOC-CRM dataset has a _number_of_triples_in_dataset of 0.00, but its _amount_of_data_dimension_score is 0.33.
{"10459":["0.00","2025-05-04","_number_of_triples_in_dataset",{"label":"CIDOC-CRM"}]}
{"10544":["0.33","2025-05-04","_amount_of_data_dimension_score",{"label":"CIDOC-CRM"}]}
This example shows that the amount-of-data score and the raw number of triples are not directly correlated in a simple way.
A dataset can have a non-zero score even when its reported triple count is zero. Therefore, a score of 0 for this metric is not a reliable indicator that the dataset is empty.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_3.
Request: When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the data provided, an availability score of 1.00 does indicate that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working.
For example, for the dblp Knowledge Graph on 2025-08-03:
_availability_dimension_score: 1.00
_SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw: 1.00
_RDF_dump_availability_raw: 1.00
However, it is important to note that having both a working SPARQL endpoint and a data dump does not guarantee an availability score of 1.00.
For instance, on 2025-05-04, the dblp Knowledge Graph had both a working endpoint and dump, but its availability score was 0.97.
This suggests that other factors may be included in the calculation of the final availability score.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_3.
Request: if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the data provided, the answer is no. An availability score of 1 is not guaranteed even if both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are available.
Here is the evidence from the dblp Knowledge Graph dataset on May 4, 2025:
_SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw: "1.00" (meaning it is available)
_RDF_dump_availability_raw: "1.00" (meaning it is available)
_availability_dimension_score: "0.97"
Even though both the endpoint and the dump were available, the availability score was 0.97, not 1.00.
This indicates that the _availability_dimension_score is a composite metric that likely includes other factors, such as URI dereferenceability or the presence of metadata files (like a VoID file, which was absent for this dataset).
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_4.
Request: if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the data provided, a value of "1" for a license-related measure does not automatically mean that an open license is used.
Here's a breakdown of what it signifies:
A value of 1.00 for measures like _machine_readable_license_metadata or _human_readable_license indicates that the specific check for that type of license information was successful (i.e., some form of license information was found and is accessible).
It does not evaluate the type of license. The check is for the presence of the information, not its content.
To determine if the license is open, you must look at the corresponding _raw fields.
Examples from the data:
Open License Found: For the dblp Knowledge Graph, _machine_readable_license_metadata is 1.00. The actual license is found in _machine_readable_license_metadata_raw, which is http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-zero (a public domain/open license).
No License Found: For CIDOC-CRM, _machine_readable_license_metadata is 1.00, but the corresponding _machine_readable_license_metadata_raw value is False, and its _licensing_dimension_score is 0.00, indicating no valid license was actually found.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_4.
Request: If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, a value of 1.00 for a license-related measure does not, by itself, mean that an open license is used. Instead, it indicates that a license was successfully found and retrieved.
To determine if the license is open, you must look at the corresponding _raw field, which contains the URL to the actual license.
Let's look at a few examples from the file:
Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science:
_human_readable_license is 1.00.
The corresponding _human_readable_license_raw is http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.1/jp/, which is a Creative Commons (open) license.
BBC Programmes:
_machine_readable_license_metadata is 1.00.
The corresponding _machine_readable_license_metadata_raw is http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by, which is a Creative Commons (open) license.
dblp Knowledge Graph:
_machine_readable_license_metadata is 1.00.
The corresponding _machine_readable_license_metadata_raw is http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-zero, which is the Creative Commons Zero (open) license.
In summary, the value 1.00 signifies the presence of a license, not its type. However, in all the examples within this data, when a license is present (indicated by 1.00), it happens to be an open license.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_5.
Request: If believability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
No, based on the data provided, a _believability_dimension_score of 1.00 does not mean that all information about providers is set.
For example, the "Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality" dataset has a _believability_dimension_score of "1.00".
However, for the same dataset, the value for the _authors metric is "False", indicating that this specific provider information is not set.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_5.
Request: If the believability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the information provided, a believability score of 1 does not mean that all provider information is available.
For example, the "Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality" dataset has a _believability_dimension_score of 1.00, but the value for its _authors is "False", indicating that this information is not provided.
--------------------------------------------------
