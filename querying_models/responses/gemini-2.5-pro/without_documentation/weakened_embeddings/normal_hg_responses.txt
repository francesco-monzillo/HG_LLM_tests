--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why is the availability score equals to 1 for the DBLP dataset?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data from 2025-08-03, the availability score for the dblp Knowledge Graph is 1.00 because its key availability metrics all have a perfect score. This composite score is calculated from the following underlying measures:
SPARQL Endpoint Availability: The _SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw score is 1.00 (Fact 19601).
RDF Dump Availability: The _RDF_dump_availability_raw score is 1.00 (Fact 19602).
URI Dereferenceability: The _URIs_dereferenceability_raw score is 1.00 (Fact 19603).
Since the SPARQL endpoint is available, the RDF dump is accessible, and the URIs are dereferenceable, the dataset achieves a perfect overall availability dimension score.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
Based on the provided data, the dblp Knowledge Graph had an availability score of 1.00 on August 3, 2025.
This score is based on the high accessibility of its data through two primary methods:
SPARQL Endpoint: The SPARQL endpoint was fully available, with a raw availability score of 1.00.
RDF Dump: The dataset provides a readily available RDF dump for download, which also had a raw availability score of 1.00. The specific download URLs are listed as https://doi.org/10.4230/dblp.rdf.ntriples and https://dblp.org/rdf/dblp.ttl.gz.
It's worth noting that this score can fluctuate. For instance, on September 7, 2025, the availability score was recorded as 0.75.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_2.
Request: Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the data provided, a score of 0 for the amount of data dimension does not mean the dataset is empty.
For instance, the dataset CIDOC-CRM has a _number_of_triples_in_dataset of "0.00", but its _amount_of_data_dimension_score is "0.33". This indicates that the score is not a direct representation of the triple count.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_2.
Request: If the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
Based on the data provided, an amount-of-data score of 0 does not necessarily mean the dataset contains no data, as there is a contradictory example.
Here is a breakdown of the evidence:
General Trend: For most datasets, a non-zero _amount_of_data_dimension_score corresponds to a significant number of triples.
dblp Knowledge Graph has a score of 0.33 and 1,335,106,894 triples.
Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science has a score of 0.67 and 303,138,983 triples.
Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality has a score of 0.33 and 18,963,939 triples.
Contradictory Example: The dataset CIDOC-CRM is listed with a _number_of_triples_in_dataset of 0.00, but it has an _amount_of_data_dimension_score of 0.33.
This inconsistency suggests that while the score is related to the number of triples, a score of 0 might not be a definitive indicator of an empty dataset, or there could be an error in the data reported for CIDOC-CRM. The most direct measure is the _number_of_triples_in_dataset itself.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_3.
Request: When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, an availability score of 1.00 is not guaranteed even if both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working.
Here's a breakdown of the data:
dblp Knowledge Graph: This dataset has a high availability score of 0.97. For this dataset, the _SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw is 1.00 and the _RDF_dump_availability_raw is 1.00, meaning both are available.
BPR ? Bibliography of the Italian Parliament and electoral studies: This dataset also has both a _SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw of 1.00 and an _RDF_dump_availability_raw of 1.00. However, its _availability_dimension_score is only 0.50.
Coronavirus dataset: This dataset has a _SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw of 1.00 but its _RDF_dump_availability_raw is -1.00 (unavailable). Its availability score is 0.74.
This indicates that while the availability of both a SPARQL endpoint and a data dump contributes to the score, other factors are also considered. Therefore, having both available does not automatically result in a perfect score of 1.00.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_3.
Request: if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the data provided, it appears that for the _availability_dimension_score to be 1.00, both the SPARQL endpoint and the RDF data dump must be available.
For example, for the dblp Knowledge Graph on 2025-08-03:
_availability_dimension_score: 1.00
_SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw: 1.00 (up)
_RDF_dump_availability_raw: 1.00 (up)
However, the reverse is not always true. A dataset can have both its SPARQL endpoint and data dump available but still have an availability score of less than 1.00.
For instance, for the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science on 2025-05-04:
_SPARQL_endpoint_availability_raw: 1.00 (up)
_RDF_dump_availability_raw: 1.00 (up)
_availability_dimension_score: 0.70
This indicates that while the availability of both access methods is a necessary condition for a perfect score of 1.00, other factors are also considered in the calculation of the final availability score.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_4.
Request: if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, a score of 1.00 for a license-related measure indicates that license information was successfully found and is accessible, but it does not inherently guarantee that the license is an "open" one.
Here's a breakdown of what the different license metrics mean:
_machine_readable_license_metadata / _human_readable_license: A score of 1.00 on these metrics means that a machine-readable or human-readable license was found, respectively. For example, "Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science" has a score of 1.00 for _human_readable_license because a link to the license was found (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.1/jp/).
_R1_1_machine_or_human_readable_license_retrievable_via_any_primary_source: This is a composite metric. A score of 1.00 indicates that some form of license (either machine or human-readable) was successfully retrieved.
_licensing_dimension_score: This appears to be an overall score for how well the license is specified.
A score of 1.00 (e.g., for "Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science") indicates the license is very clearly and accessibly specified.
A score of 0.50 (e.g., for "dblp Knowledge Graph" and "BBC Programmes") can still correspond to an open license (cc-zero and cc-by, respectively), but it suggests the license information was not found in all the ways the system checked.
A score of 0.00 (e.g., for "CIDOC-CRM") indicates no license information was found.
In summary, a score of 1 means the license information is present and accessible. While in many of the provided examples this corresponds to an open license like Creative Commons, the score itself measures the availability of the information, not the specific terms of the license.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_4.
Request: If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
Based on the provided data, the answer is yes. A value of 1.00 for a license-related metric indicates that an open license was successfully detected.
Here is a more detailed breakdown:
_licensing_dimension_score: This appears to be the main score for the licensing dimension.
A score of 1.00 means both a machine-readable and a human-readable open license were found (e.g., "Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science").
A score of 0.50 means an open license was found in at least one form, but not all checks passed. For example, "dblp Knowledge Graph" has a machine-readable license (cc-zero) but its human-readable license check scored 0.00, resulting in an overall score of 0.50.
Component Metrics: The overall score is derived from other metrics like:
_machine_readable_license_metadata: A value of 1.00 indicates a machine-readable license (like http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by) was found.
_human_readable_license: A value of 1.00 indicates a human-readable license (like http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.1/jp/) was found.
In summary, if you see a _licensing_dimension_score of 1.00 or 0.50, or a 1.00 on the individual _machine_readable_license_metadata or _human_readable_license metrics, it confirms that an open license is used for the dataset.
--------------------------------------------------

Question: E&D_5.
Request: If believability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the provided data, a believability score of 1.0 is strongly correlated with the provider being on a trusted list, which is a key piece of provider information. It doesn't necessarily mean that every single piece of provider information is set, but it indicates that the most critical ones for establishing trust are met.
Here is a breakdown of the evidence from the file:
Dataset with Believability of 1.00:
The dataset "Linked Open Camera (LinkedOpenData.it)" has a _believability_dimension_score of 1.00.
Crucially, this same dataset has a value of "1" for the measure _is_on_trusted_providers_list (chunk 6006).
Datasets with Believability less than 1.00:
dblp Knowledge Graph, Allie Abbreviation And Long Form Database in Life Science, and NoiPA all have a _believability_dimension_score of 0.80.
All three of these datasets have a value of "0" for _is_on_trusted_providers_list.
Furthermore, they are often missing other provider details. For example, dblp Knowledge Graph is not signed (_signed: False), and has no specified contributors or publishers (_contributors: None, _publishers: None).
Therefore, while your hypothesis is on the right track, a more precise conclusion is that a believability score of 1.0 appears to be given when the dataset's provider is on a trusted list, which is a definitive indicator of its source and credibility.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_5.
Request: If the believability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Based on the information provided, a believability score of 1 does not mean that all provider information is available.
For example, the "Environment Agency Bathing Water Quality" dataset has a _believability_dimension_score of 1.00.
However, for this same dataset, the _contributors_specified is 0.00 and the value for _authors is False, indicating that this information is not available.
--------------------------------------------------
