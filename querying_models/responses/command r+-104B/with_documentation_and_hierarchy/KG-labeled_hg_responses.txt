Question: IR_5.
Request: How trustworthy is the Linked Open Camera dataset?
Expected Response: 0.5
Response:
The Linked Open Camera dataset has a Verifiability score of 0.11, which indicates that it may have some issues related to verifiability. However, without further context or details about this specific metric, I cannot provide more insights into why this particular score was assigned.

It's important to note that the assessment of datasets' quality and reliability is a complex process that involves various factors, including data accuracy, consistency, timeliness, and more. Therefore, relying solely on one metric might not give a comprehensive view of the overall trustworthiness of a dataset. It's recommended to consider multiple aspects and perform thorough evaluations before drawing conclusions about a dataset's trustworthiness.

Question: TA_2.
Request: Is the SPARQL endpoint of DBLP always available?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Yes, the SPARQL endpoint of DBLP was available on July 13, August 3, September 7, and May 4, 2025. However, there were some issues with accessing the endpoint on these dates, resulting in errors like "HTTP Error 504: Gateway Timeout" and "HTTP Error 504: Gateway Timeout".

It's important to note that while the SPARQL endpoint may have been available on these specific dates, there could still be occasional downtime or maintenance periods when it might become temporarily unavailable. It's recommended to check the status of the endpoint regularly to ensure uninterrupted access.

Vote:

Question: TA_2.
Request: Is the DBLP SPARQL endpoint always up?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Yes, according to my knowledge base's most recent records dated September 7, 2025, the DBLP SPARQL endpoint was reported as being active. However, I do not possess real-time status monitoring capabilities, so this may change between now and then.

If you require more detailed insights into the reliability of specific endpoints like uptime percentages or response times, consider implementing dedicated tools designed explicitly for website performance tracking.

Question: TA_3.
Request: Is the data dump of the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset always set to 1 in the observed period?
Expected Response: No, it is discontinuous
Response:
The `Always Set To` metric was found only once, which indicates insufficient evidence regarding whether this statement holds true across different time periods within your specified range.

To provide more comprehensive insights into how often each metric has been assigned its highest possible rating during various intervals throughout history, further analysis would be required using additional datasets spanning multiple years. This could help determine if there have been consistent improvements or fluctuations in these metrics' performance levels over time.

Question: TA_3.
Request: Is the data dump of the Allie Abbreviation And Long Form dataset always up?
Expected Response: No, it is discontinuous
Response:
The most recent version of this knowledge graph was released on August 3, 2023. The previous release dates back to June 1st, so there has been no new releases within two months.
However, I cannot determine how often these datasets get refreshed due to missing documentation about its refresh rate. Therefore, we can't say definitively when they will be next updated nor confirm your assumption regarding constant freshness.

Question: TA_4.
Request: Is the accuracy of NoiPA constant over time?
Expected Response: No
Response:
The Accuracy Score metric has been stable across different dates from May 4, 2024 until September 7, 2025. The most recent evaluation was conducted on August 3rd, resulting in an overall rating of 1 out of 1 possible points within this category.

However, it's important to note that these evaluations were based solely on automated assessments using specific criteria outlined under each respective section heading. Human review may provide additional insights into areas like data freshness, which could impact perceived reliability depending on use cases. It would be beneficial to conduct regular manual checks alongside automatic ones to ensure comprehensive monitoring of your knowledge graph’s health status.

Question: Co_2.
Request: Which is the worst performing dataset in the license metric?
Expected Response: CIDOC-CRM
Response:
The worst performing dataset in the license metric is the dataset with the following characteristics:

- Name: LemmaBank
- Date: 2025-05-04
- License human redeable: -
- License machine redeable (metadata): -
- License machine redeable (query): -
- _human_readable_license_metadata_is_retrievable: 0.0
- _human_readable_license_query_is_retrievable: 0.0
- _machine_readable_license_metadata_is_retrievable: 1.0
- _machine_readable_license_query_is_retrievable: 1.0

This dataset has a low score in the license metric due to the absence of a human-readable license and a machine-readable license in both the metadata and query. The _human_readable_license_metadata_is_retrievable and _human_readable_license_query_is_retrievable scores are 0.0, indicating that the human-readable license is not indicated in the metadata or query. The _machine_readable_license_metadata_is_retrievable and _machine_readable_license_query_is_retrievable scores are 1.0, suggesting that the machine-readable license is indicated in the metadata and query. However, the absence of a human-readable license and a machine-readable license in both the metadata and query results in a low overall score for the license metric.

Question: E&D_2.
Request: Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
No, a score of 0 for the amount of data dimension does not necessarily mean that the dataset is empty. The amount of data dimension is calculated based on the number of triples, the number of labels or comments, and the percentage of triples with labels. If a dataset has a low number of triples, a low number of labels or comments, or a low percentage of triples with labels, it may result in a low score for the amount of data dimension.

It's important to note that the amount of data dimension is just one aspect of the overall quality assessment, and a low score in this dimension does not necessarily indicate that the dataset is of poor quality overall. It's essential to consider the scores in other dimensions, such as accuracy, completeness, and consistency, to get a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's quality.
