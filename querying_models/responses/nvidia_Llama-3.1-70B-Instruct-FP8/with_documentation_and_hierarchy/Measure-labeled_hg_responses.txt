Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
The availability score is equal to 1 for the DBLP dataset because it has a high availability score, which is a measure of how easily accessible the dataset is. This is likely due to the fact that the DBLP dataset is a well-established and widely-used dataset in the field of computer science, and it is hosted on a reliable server with a stable URL. Additionally, the dataset is available in multiple formats, including RDF, which makes it easily accessible to users who want to use it for various purposes.

Vote:
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_1.
Request: Why does the DBLP dataset have an availability score of 1?
Expected Response: Because all the metrics in the availability dimension can be correctly computed
Response:
The DBLP dataset has an availability score of 1 because it meets all the criteria for availability. It has a working access point (SPARQL endpoint), the data is available for download as an RDF dump, and the metadata is available. Additionally, the dataset is registered in a searchable engine, which makes it easily discoverable. All these factors contribute to its high availability score.

Vote:
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_2.
Request: Does a score of amount of data equals to 0 mean that the dataset is empty?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
No, a score of amount of data equals to 0 does not necessarily mean that the dataset is empty. The amount of data score is a metric that evaluates the quantity of data in a dataset, but it's not a direct measure of the dataset's emptiness.

A score of 0 could indicate that the dataset has a very small amount of data, or that the data is not well-represented in the metrics used to calculate the score. It's also possible that the dataset is not empty, but the metrics used to calculate the score are not able to capture the complexity or richness of the data.

To determine if a dataset is truly empty, you would need to examine the dataset itself, rather than relying solely on the amount of data score.

Vote:
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_2.
Request: if the amount-of-data score is 0, does that mean the dataset contains no data?
Expected Response: No, it means that the amount of data cannot be computed via the SPARQL endpoint and it is not declared in the metadata.
Response:
No, if the amount-of-data score is 0, it doesn't necessarily mean the dataset contains no data. 

The amount-of-data score is a metric that evaluates the amount of data in a dataset based on several factors such as the number of triples, entities, and properties. A score of 0 might indicate that the dataset has a very small amount of data or that the data is not well-represented in the metrics used to calculate the score.

There could be several reasons why a dataset receives an amount-of-data score of 0, including:

* The dataset is very small or sparse.
* The dataset uses a non-standard or proprietary data format that is not recognized by the metrics.
* The dataset is incomplete or missing important information.
* The metrics used to calculate the score are not suitable for the type of data in the dataset.

It's also possible that the dataset contains data, but it's not well-represented in the metrics used to calculate the score. For example, a dataset might contain a large number of images or videos, but if the metrics only consider textual data, the score might be 0 even though the dataset contains a significant amount of data.

To determine if a dataset actually contains no data, you would need to examine the dataset itself, rather than relying solely on the amount-of-data score.

Question: E&D_3.
Request: When the availability score is 1, does it mean that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
Yes, when the availability score is 1, it means that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are working.

Vote:
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_3.
Request: if the availability score is 1, does that mean both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
According to the provided information, the Availability score is computed as a linear combination of the individual availability metrics scores. However, it doesn't explicitly state that a score of 1 means both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are up.

But based on the definitions of the individual availability metrics:

* Availability of RDF dump (query): checks if the RDF dump is provided and can be downloaded
* Sparql endpoint: checks if the SPARQL endpoint is online

It's likely that a score of 1 means that both the SPARQL endpoint and the data dump are available, but it's not explicitly stated. To confirm this, more information about how the Availability score is calculated would be needed.

Vote:
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_4.
Request: if license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
According to the provided data, if the "R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source" metric has a value of 1, it means that a license is explicitly reported, but it does not necessarily imply that an open license is used.

To determine if an open license is used, you would need to check the specific license mentioned in the "License machine redeable (metadata)" or "License machine redeable (query)" metrics, which provide the actual license text or URI.

For example, if the license is set to "http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by", it indicates that the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license is used, which is an open license. However, if the license is set to a proprietary or closed license, the value of 1 in the "R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source" metric would still indicate that a license is explicitly reported, but it would not be an open license.

Vote:
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_4.
Request: If license is set to 1, does it mean that an open license is used?
Expected Response: No, it means that a license is specified
Response:
According to the provided data, if the "R1.1 Machine- or human-readable license retrievable via any primary source" metric has a value of 1, it means that a license is explicitly reported, but it does not necessarily imply that an open license is used.

The data suggests that there are different types of licenses, such as "http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-zero", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", and "http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by-sa", among others. These licenses have different characteristics and restrictions.

To determine if an open license is used, you would need to examine the specific license value associated with the dataset, rather than just relying on the presence of a license (i.e., a value of 1).

Vote:
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_5.
Request: If verifiability is set to 1, does it mean that all information about providers are set?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
No, if verifiability is set to 1, it doesn't necessarily mean that all information about providers is set. Verifiability refers to the ability to verify the accuracy and reliability of the information provided, but it doesn't guarantee that all information about providers is complete or accurate.

In the context of the provided data, verifiability seems to be related to the "Is on a trusted provider list" metric, which checks if the provider is contained in a list of trusted providers. If this metric returns "True", it means that the provider is trusted, but it doesn't provide any additional information about the provider.

To get more information about the providers, you would need to look at other metrics, such as "Author (metadata)" or "Publisher", which provide information about the authors and publishers of the data. However, even if these metrics are set, it's still possible that some information about the providers is missing or incomplete.

Vote:
--------------------------------------------------
Question: E&D_5.
Request: If the verifiability score is 1, does it mean that all provider information is available?
Expected Response: Yes
Response:
No, the verifiability score being 1 does not necessarily mean that all provider information is available. The verifiability score is a measure of how well the dataset's metadata adheres to certain standards and best practices, but it does not guarantee that all provider information is present.

In this case, the verifiability score is 1 because the dataset's metadata meets the required standards, but the "Is on a trusted provider list" metric is False, indicating that the provider is not trusted. This suggests that while the dataset's metadata is well-formed and follows best practices, there may still be issues with the provider's reputation or trustworthiness.
