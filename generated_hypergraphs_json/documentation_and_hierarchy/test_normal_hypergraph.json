    "BPR ? Bibliography of the Italian Parliament and electoral studies": {},
    "**dati.camera.it - Linked Open Data della Camera dei deputati**  \r\n**The BPR - Bibliografia del Parlamento italiano e degli studi elettorali**  (Bibliography of the Italian Parliament and Electoral Studies) is a database of bibliographic references of books and articles in periodical journals addressing the history of the Italian Parliament and the history of elections. In particular the BPR provides references to studies on:  \r\n\r\n* the Italian Parliament. from the concession of the Statuto Albertino (Albertine Statute) in 1848. the National Consultative Assembly and the Constituent Assembly;\r\n* elections (laws. procedures. results). with reference to general elections as from 1848.  \r\n\r\nThe BPR addresses primarily studies in law. plus studies in political science. organisational science. political sociology. as well as related historiographical literature. In 2002 the BPR started reporting documents posted on the leading juridical websites.  \r\nEach bibliographic reference is assigned one or more classification codes. which are taken from a directory of over 100 classifications organized into seven major fields.  \r\nThe BPR is also a digital library updated non-stop. By using documents in the public domain or available thanks to agreements with private publishers. it provides a selection of full-text documents (monographs. judgements. articles from periodicals. contributions to miscellaneous works) attached to the bibliographic reference.": {},

In particular the BPR provides references to studies on:  \r\n\r\n* the Italian Parliament. from the concession of the Statuto Albertino (Albertine Statute) in 1848. the National Consultative Assembly and the Constituent Assembly;\r\n* elections (laws. procedures. results). with reference to general elections as from 1848.  \r\n\r\nThe BPR addresses primarily studies in law. plus studies in political science. organisational science. political sociology. as well as related historiographical literature. In 2002 the BPR started reporting documents posted on the leading juridical websites.  \r\nEach bibliographic reference is assigned one or more classification codes. which are taken from a directory of over 100 classifications organized into seven major fields.  \r\nThe BPR is also a digital library updated non-stop. By using documents in the public domain or available thanks to agreements with private publishers. it provides a selection of full-text documents (monographs. judgements. articles from periodicals. contributions to miscellaneous works) attached to the bibliographic reference.",

        "The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) is a theoretical and practical tool for information integration in the field of cultural heritage. It can help researchers. administrators and the public explore complex questions with regards to our past across diverse and dispersed datasets. The CIDOC CRM achieves this by providing definitions and a formal structure for describing the implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in cultural heritage documentation and of general interest for the querying and exploration of such data. Such models are also known as formal ontologies. These formal descriptions allow the integration of data from multiple sources in a software and schema agnostic fashion."

In particular the BPR provides references to studies on:  \r\n\r\n* the Italian Parliament. from the concession of the Statuto Albertino (Albertine Statute) in 1848. the National Consultative Assembly and the Constituent Assembly;\r\n* elections (laws. procedures. results). with reference to general elections as from 1848.  \r\n\r\nThe BPR addresses primarily studies in law. plus studies in political science. organisational science. political sociology. as well as related historiographical literature. In 2002 the BPR started reporting documents posted on the leading juridical websites.  \r\nEach bibliographic reference is assigned one or more classification codes. which are taken from a directory of over 100 classifications organized into seven major fields.  \r\nThe BPR is also a digital library updated non-stop. By using documents in the public domain or available thanks to agreements with private publishers. it provides a selection of full-text documents (monographs. judgements. articles from periodicals. contributions to miscellaneous works) attached to the bibliographic reference.",

        "The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) is a theoretical and practical tool for information integration in the field of cultural heritage. It can help researchers. administrators and the public explore complex questions with regards to our past across diverse and dispersed datasets. The CIDOC CRM achieves this by providing definitions and a formal structure for describing the implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in cultural heritage documentation and of general interest for the querying and exploration of such data. Such models are also known as formal ontologies. These formal descriptions allow the integration of data from multiple sources in a software and schema agnostic fashion.",

In particular the BPR provides references to studies on:  \r\n\r\n* the Italian Parliament. from the concession of the Statuto Albertino (Albertine Statute) in 1848. the National Consultative Assembly and the Constituent Assembly;\r\n* elections (laws. procedures. results). with reference to general elections as from 1848.  \r\n\r\nThe BPR addresses primarily studies in law. plus studies in political science. organisational science. political sociology. as well as related historiographical literature. In 2002 the BPR started reporting documents posted on the leading juridical websites.  \r\nEach bibliographic reference is assigned one or more classification codes. which are taken from a directory of over 100 classifications organized into seven major fields.  \r\nThe BPR is also a digital library updated non-stop. By using documents in the public domain or available thanks to agreements with private publishers. it provides a selection of full-text documents (monographs. judgements. articles from periodicals. contributions to miscellaneous works) attached to the bibliographic reference.",

        "**dati.camera.it - Linked Open Data della Camera dei deputati**  \r\n**The BPR - Bibliografia del Parlamento italiano e degli studi elettorali**  (Bibliography of the Italian Parliament and Electoral Studies) is a database of bibliographic references of books and articles in periodical journals addressing the history of the Italian Parliament and the history of elections. In particular the BPR provides references to studies on:  \r\n\r\n* the Italian Parliament. from the concession of the Statuto Albertino (Albertine Statute) in 1848. the National Consultative Assembly and the Constituent Assembly;\r\n* elections (laws. procedures. results). with reference to general elections as from 1848.  \r\n\r\nThe BPR addresses primarily studies in law. plus studies in political science. organisational science. political sociology. as well as related historiographical literature. In 2002 the BPR started reporting documents posted on the leading juridical websites.  \r\nEach bibliographic reference is assigned one or more classification codes. which are taken from a directory of over 100 classifications organized into seven major fields.  \r\nThe BPR is also a digital library updated non-stop. By using documents in the public domain or available thanks to agreements with private publishers. it provides a selection of full-text documents (monographs. judgements. articles from periodicals. contributions to miscellaneous works) attached to the bibliographic reference.",

It can help researchers. administrators and the public explore complex questions with regards to our past across diverse and dispersed datasets. The CIDOC CRM achieves this by providing definitions and a formal structure for describing the implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in cultural heritage documentation and of general interest for the querying and exploration of such data. Such models are also known as formal ontologies. These formal descriptions allow the integration of data from multiple sources in a software and schema agnostic fashion.",
